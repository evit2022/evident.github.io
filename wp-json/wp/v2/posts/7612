that earns money by producing and selling goods or services. <b>A brand <\/b>is the identity or image of that business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at Starbucks\u2019s branding as an example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that Starbucks is a good example because whether you\u2019re a coffee drinker or not, <b>Starbucks needs no introduction.<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You only need to get a glimpse of the iconic green siren logo, and your mind goes immediately to Starbucks and the premium drinks and pastries they offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-full

It\u2019s a brand that will last in the years to come \u2014 largely thanks to strategic brand management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a consumer sees your logo, what do you hope will come to mind? How can consumers differentiate you from your competitors?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to build a brand that thrives, you need to start at the beginning \u2014 creating a brand strategy by defining your goals and conducting research into your market, audience and competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How-To-Build-A-Brand-A-Step-By-Step-Guide\"><\/span>How To Build A Brand: A Step-By-Step Guide<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you know the difference between a business and a brand, but how <i>exactly<\/i> do you build a brand?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This branding roadmap will lay out six key steps,<\/strong> packed with tips and tactics about brand strategies, identity, communication and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step-1-Create-A-Brand-Strategy\"><\/span>Step 1: Create A Brand Strategy<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To develop an effective brand strategy, start with setting clear goals and creating an action plan to accomplish them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, conduct market and audience research and perform competitor analysis to find gaps, position your brand and clarify your unique value proposition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As our digital strategist, Zorica Marjanovic, puts it:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;A brand strategy opens up new opportunities that can kick start exponential growth, whether for a start-up, medium-sized enterprise or a well-known company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Define Your Goals: Why Are You Building A Brand?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When utilizing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/branding-agency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">branding services<\/a> to build your brand from scratch or rebrand your business, you must think of the reasons why. Your reasons may vary, depending on your industry, niche, direct and indirect competitors, business model and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If you run an emerging start-up<\/strong>, you might want to create a solid company culture based on your core business values to increase audience engagement across channels<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>If your business is already well-established<\/strong> and you delegate external communications to multiple parties, you might want to create consistency in your brand appearance to increase customer retention rates<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>If you want to drive your business in a different direction<\/strong> or you want to overcome a brand-damaging crisis, you might want to start a rebranding process but still remain relevant for your audience<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the reason, setting clear goals and defining your brand&#8217;s purpose will help you build a strong brand and grow your visibility, credibility, authority and trust through coherent presentation and targeted communication across channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As Zorica explains,<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;In the age of digital, you\u2019re either beautiful or you\u2019re smart or you\u2019re practical. Brand purpose here is a total underdog. That\u2019s why its victories are so fascinating, and when they happen, they shine brighter than anything else.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Market Research: Which Insights Can You Detect?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you know which direction you want to go, it\u2019s time for research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Market research will help you gather your industry, niche and category specifics to make better-informed decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your strategy will largely depend on your industry. If you&#8217;re in the financial industry, for example, your strategy will differ from brands in the manufacturing industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is a great way to gain valuable insights into consumers\u2019 typical behaviors, expectations, reactions and objections related to your product category or the type of services you offer.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you gather these insights, it\u2019s going to be easier for you to define your competitive advantage and find opportunities for growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This step will help you see the bigger picture, find insights about your market and truly understand your audience behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Audience Research: How To Build A Brand Your Audience Will Love<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Audience research will help you define your main target audience and different audience groups you serve and help you create specific buyer personas for each of these groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can conduct audience research using some of these methods:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Focus groups<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>One-on-one interviews<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Conference calls<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Online surveys<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Social media groups<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Talking to your prospective customers will help you acknowledge their needs, problems, drives, pain points and issues they might encounter in interaction with your company.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, you\u2019ll be able to position your brand to help your customers solve their problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also organize usability testing sessions for your website, especially if you run an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/services\/ecommerce-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eCommerce site<\/a> or a cloud-based business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help you define clear user flows, address the right issues at the right time and create smooth checkout processes to grow your conversion rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"box-cta -bg -border -narrow lazy colors-inverted\"\n     data-bg=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Digital-Marketing-655x230.jpg\">\n\n\t        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/custom-intent-audiences\" class=\"box-cta__wrap\">\n    \n        <div class=\"box-cta__text-wrap\">\n            <div class=\"l-heading-v3\">\n                <div class=\"c-heading -h2\">\n                                            <span class=\"c-heading__pre\">YOU MAY ALSO LIKE<\/span>\n                    \n                                            <div class=\"c-heading__title\">Custom Intent Audiences: How To Target More Prospects With Your Campaigns<\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"box-cta__icon\">\n            <svg class=\"icon icon-lib-icon-arrow-right-big \"  aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#lib-icon-arrow-right-big\"><\/use><\/svg>        <\/div>\n\n            <\/a>\n    \n<\/div>\n\n\n<h3>Competitor Analysis: Learn From Their Branding Triumphs &amp; Mistakes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Competitor research will help you learn everything you need to know about your competitors and find opportunities to differentiate your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But before you get down to analysis, observe your competitors\u2019 online activities.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself: Have any of your competitors had a successful <a href=\"\/types-of-branding-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">branding<\/a> campaign lately? What did they do? How was it different from their previous activities? How did their results impact your business? What can you learn from that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After answering these questions, you can use online tools to perform a website audit and an SEO analysis for competitors\u2019 websites to find out about:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Their overall website performance<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keywords they rank for in search results<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Digital marketing channels they use<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Types of content they publish<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Business directories they have a profile on<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use the information to learn from your competitors\u2019 branding mistakes and inconsistencies or from the segments in which their brand saw major success.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use this step to fill the existing gaps with your original ideas, different approaches and unique strategies for your brand positioning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SWOT Analysis: How To Find Your Unique Value Proposition<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the previous step, you can perform a SWOT analysis to help you paint a clearer picture of your own branding possibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A SWOT analysis will help you define your:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Strengths<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weaknesses<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Opportunities<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Threats<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use a simple four-square matrix to list all of these points. This will help you come up with potential activities, define areas you need to improve, find opportunities for growth and make a proper risk assessment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As Zorica explains, <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The main goal of a SWOT analysis is to find strengths that meet opportunities.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A SWOT analysis is also a great methodology to learn your unique point-of-view, find your comparative advantage, position your brand the right way and craft a unique value proposition.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A unique value proposition (UVP) is a single sentence or a set of sentences that clearly communicate the value your products or services bring to your audience.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should describe how you solve your customers\u2019 problems and state why they should choose your company over competitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It needs to be simple, concise, attractive, easily relatable and immediately understandable. So, avoid using buzzwords, industry jargon and meaningless fluff in your UVP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the most of it, put this statement in the hero section of your website home page.

They can help you stand out, fight for a cause, keep a purpose behind every decision and make a strong connection with your audience, even beyond your products or services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To build your brand persona<\/strong>, you need to determine:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>What your company stands for<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What drives you forward<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Why you do what you do<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Why you care about bringing your brand to people<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Why people should care about your brand<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your brand values might reflect social, cultural, political, economic or other views relevant to your business. When you clearly define your values, incorporate them into your key branding statements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Phrase Your Key Branding Statements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides a unique value proposition, key branding statements can include <strong>a tagline, mission and vision statements, an elevator pitch, a company culture manifesto, your personal story<\/strong> and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When phrasing these statements, make sure to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep them simple, clear and concise<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>List the benefits front and center<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Speak directly to your audience<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To make your statements instantly relatable, use the language your audience uses, a.k.a. the Voice of the Customer (VOC). This way, you can avoid industry jargon, buzzwords and fluff that can confuse your potential customers and harm your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Document Your Brand Voice<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the voice of your customers, your brand should have its own voice clearly defined and documented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be as specific as possible when defining your voice.<\/strong> Don\u2019t just say your brand voice is \u201cfriendly.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, try something like this: \u201cWe communicate with customers as if we are talking to a close friend. We are open and honest when we make a mistake. We are patient and supportive when our customers need help. We show empathy and interest in the problems they come across.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can help provide clarity about your brand voice and the tone of voice you\u2019ll use in different situations, depending on the context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use your voice and tone guide as a cornerstone of all your branded communications.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Include the vocabulary with words and phrases your brand uses, branded hashtags, emojis and grammar, spelling and formatting guidelines to keep all written communications consistent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some popular brand voice examples and how the brand archetype is reflected within each:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nike uses powerful action words and phrases<\/strong> like \u201cJust Do It.\u201d Also, Nike recently sent a powerful message in support of racial equality: \u201cFor once, Don\u2019t Do It.\u201d Nike is The Hero brand archetype and these messages perfectly align with its heroic character.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>IBM uses its century-long expertise to send a purpose-driven message<\/strong> like the one in the \u201cLet\u2019s Build a Smarter Planet\u201d campaign that served to unite and inspire employees. IBM is The Sage brand archetype and its voice is purposeful, thoughtful and knowledge-based.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple uses notions of innovation, creativity and freedom to evoke the emotions<\/strong> and aspirations of its customers in their brand messages, like the tagline \u201cThink Different.\u201d Even though it\u2019s grammatically imperfect, this tagline is perfectly aligned with The Creator archetype.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s highly recommended to document your brand voice in a guide. Why? To keep everyone in your company on the same page and keep your brand appearance consistent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Consistency is the key to branding success.<\/strong> If your brand isn\u2019t cohesive, customers will never take you seriously.
