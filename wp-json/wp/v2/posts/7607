Which keywords are they ranking for? How many backlinks do they have?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>On-site content posting frequency<\/strong>: How often do they post new content to their blog or resources section?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Social media posting frequency<\/strong>: What social media do they use? How often do they post on each?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Site performance<\/strong>: How many monthly do they attract?

For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cWomen&#8217;s shoes international delivery&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Best restaurants in New York&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;Top product design agencies in Los Angeles&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An effective SEO strategy can help you rank in Google for relevant terms and entice prospects who are looking for what you have to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/website-marketing-seo-stat-1.jpg\" alt=\"SEO drives 1000%+ more organic traffic than social media\u200b\" class=\"wp-image-2522\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>Strategy #2: Pay-Per-Click Ads<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay-per-click ads (PPC) drive traffic to websites via search engine ads. The most commonly used PPC ad networks are Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Bing Ads and Instagram Ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PPC is an effective way of driving more traffic to a website and keeping ROI rates high. <strong>On average, paid advertising returns <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordlead.com\/facts\/ppc-statistics-adwords-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$2<\/a> for every $1 spent.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You pay for PPC ads only when someone clicks on them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main advantage of using PPC lies in the targeting options. Depending on the platform you advertise on, you\u2019ll have a different set of targeting options. The most common are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Location(s)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gender<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Age groups<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the more refined targeting options, like on LinkedIn and Facebook for example, may also include \u201cinterests\u201d and more nuanced demographic filtering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This is the secret behind PPC\u2019s effectiveness;<\/strong> It helps you funnel highly targeted audiences into your website, increasing the chances for conversion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need help?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agencies can help businesses create PPC campaigns with eye-catching headlines and text. <a href=\"\/digital-trends\/website-development-consultants\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Website development consultants<\/a> can fully manage bidding strategies to maximize the reach and ROI of every campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Strategy #3: Native Ads<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Native advertising means using paid ads in a way that matches the look, design and function of the website they are featured on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They often appear as recommended content on a web pages with related topics &#8211; most often, publishing platforms. Native ads blend in with the environment and look like the conceptual and contextual part of the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Native ads are non-disruptive<\/strong> because they expose the reader to advertising content without sticking out as a distraction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research shows that consumers look at native ads <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/nativeadvertising\/consumers-look-at-native-ads-more-than-display-according-to-new-study-764843bd771d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">53%<\/a> more than display ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also reportedly<strong> boost purchase intent with users by 18%.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-2497\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/website-marketing-strategies-example-of-native-advertising-min.jpg\" alt=\"website marketing strategies - example of native advertising-min\" class=\"wp-image-2497\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Example of native ads via Business Insider<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>Strategy #4: Email Campaigns<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Email marketing is one of the most useful and effective forms of website marketing for businesses of all sizes. Email campaigns boost sales, help pull back returning visitors and reduce cart abandonment rates for eCommerce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email marketing is also highly lucrative &#8211; it has an average ROI of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.litmus.com\/resources\/email-marketing-roi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">4,200%<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a website marketing tool, cold emails \u2013 emails sent to prospective customers with no previous contact with your organization \u2013 can help you attract new qualified audiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email marketing campaigns, or emails sent to a subscriber base, can help you reengage your audience, i.e. bring them back to your website, increasing brand retention and conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Request a consultation &#038; custom proposal for your project<\/span>\n                <a class=\"arrow-right black\" href=\"\/request-a-quote\/\"  rel=\"noopener\">\n            Request A Proposal        <\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Strategy #5: Content Marketing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Content marketing is a website marketing strategy that attracts highly qualified leads into your website\u2019s sales funnel and forms a user journey for maximum conversion rates \u2014&nbsp;speaking of, check out our<a href=\"\/digital-trends\/conversion-funnel-user-journey\/#What-Is-A-User-Journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> guide to optimizing your conversion funnels and user journey<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, <strong>content marketing costs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.demandmetric.com\/content\/content-marketing-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">62%<\/a> less than traditional marketing and generates about three times as many leads.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Promoting your website means essentially promoting its content, so designing a content marketing strategy is a very important step in creating your website\u2019s marketing plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content marketing strategy should, when possible, strategically encompass all of these subsets:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Blog articles<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Web copy<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Digital PR<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Infographics<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>White papers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>eBooks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Video marketing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Checklists<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Podcasts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Why should businesses blog?

It is a subset of content marketing that taps into the talent and experience within your organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To build thought leadership that attracts your target market, one of the best ways to establish authority on your topic is to produce deep research on the subject.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, you have to present in-depth knowledge that no one else in your industry has.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do that, follow these steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tap into questions your potential customers are asking<\/strong>: Turn to forums like Reddit, Quora, Yahoo Answers, UberSuggest and others to find out what questions your target audience is asking about your business.
