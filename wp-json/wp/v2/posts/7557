Now they are mini-computers that can receive your emails, play multimedia and games, transfer files and even act as smartphones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hugely commercialized and usable across the spectrum, smartwatches possess a wide array of applications that make them an ideal candidate for workplace assistance and business incorporation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Type #2: Health\/Fitness Trackers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fitness trackers are pretty self-explanatory \u2013 they monitor heart rate, blood pressure, calorie consumption, distance walked and other indicators of one\u2019s state of health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These wearables can be strapped around the wrist or thigh, worn attached to clothing or on an armband and even implemented in running shoes with sensors via GPS tracking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fitness trackers can be synchronized with mobile apps in order to measure data more precisely so that individuals using them can be certain they are getting accurate readings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though life-saving technology like pacemakers have long been a staple of medicine, even more high-tech prosthetics and embedded electronic monitoring devices are becoming a regular part of healthcare and medicine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wearable health tech, along with the apps, can assist in diagnosing health conditions and even how severe they are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most advanced and sophisticated devices of this kind can even trace health signals such as the release of certain biochemicals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Type #3: Internet of Things<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Internet of Things is one of the most promising niches for wearables.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, it is adding the abilities of wearables, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/how-does-ai-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">artificial intelligence<\/a> and machine learning to everyday items people use in households, such as security cameras, lights, kitchen appliances and cooling systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these things are provided access to the internet through a network of wireless sensors and automation, creating the so-called concept of a \u201csmart home.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A smart home is a living space in which human intervention for adjusting the home to optimal conditions is minimal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Home, Amazon Echo and Alexa are some of the examples of these types of devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"box-cta -bg -border -narrow lazy colors-inverted\"\n

wearables, let us look at a couple of use cases for wearables in business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use Case #1: Education<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The possibilities of using wearables in education are huge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses that wish to provide their own signature product in this field have the chance to benefit schools and universities in a big way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adoption of knowledge through the use of smart glasses and VR headsets can significantly improve the way teachers and professors hold their lectures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These can be broadened to also provide virtual class trips to historically significant places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even low-budget education institutions could afford these wearables that can provide the levels and dimensions of education that would normally require a much bigger investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use Case #2: Public Service<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Professional and public services such as police and firefighters use wearable technology to help alleviate some of the risks of their daily working routine and help them do their job to the best of their ability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearable tech like smart glasses and smartwatches can alert first responders of impending dangers and provide insight into their general state and the state of their surroundings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example of wearables use in public service is the body cameras worn by law enforcement officers. They have proven themselves effective in documenting the officer\u2019s actions and providing additional video evidence from crime scenes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Wearable technology - What do consumers imagine in the future?\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/uRPG9KJy52g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Benefits-of-Wearable-Technology-in-Businesses\"><\/span>Benefits of Wearable Technology in Businesses<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearables can benefit your business in several important ways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Boost Of Employee Productivity<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearables are able to boost employee productivity by trimming down non-value activity and enabling workers to fully focus on the job they are qualified for, which is vital to good time management for every company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Improved Communication<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology such as smartwatches enables push notifications and other means of being timely informed of an important update, along with an option of responding to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such responsiveness not only strengthens communication between individual employees and work sectors, it also increases job satisfaction in workforce professions.<\/p>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Looking to leverage wearable technology for your business?

Here are a few reasons why you should consider implementing them in your workplace:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reason #1: The Wearables Market Will Continue To Grow<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a massive, yet unexplored potential of wearables in the global market that is not even in full swing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This segment is capable of pushing the envelope of everyday living and business like no other before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearable tech is an interesting ground for innovators and inventors. Investing in such a promising segment, that is still in its infancy, has become a widespread notion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reason #2: It\u2019s Trendy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies and businesses that deploy wearable technology and embed it into their workplace attain a reputation for being trendy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inventive nature of this technology assures there are myriad ways to use it, all for a different benefit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWearing internet\u201d is something that sounds appealing to most and the enhanced user experience is what makes this different from any other current trend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies that got on board with wearables before they became the norm will likely always have an edge over competitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reason #3: They Solve Real Problems<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees, managers, decision-makers and even the general population stand to gain a lot from using wearable technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already evidenced that health and safety sectors, in particular, can take pride in addressing real-life issues through these devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Substantial matters of increasing work productivity and efficiency, bridging the gaps of expenditure, even saving lives and eliminating tragic outcomes \u2013 these are problems people encounter on a regular basis, significantly softened through wearable apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reason #4: They Lead To Further Innovations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Potentially, the market of wearable technology in business is inexhaustible: the world just scratched the surface of this hugely potential segment and the opportunities seem vast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a watershed of possibilities and directions to take so that forward-thinking companies can truly partake in reshaping the workplace and translating it into the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"form-section -wide -border colors-inverted\">\n    <div class=\"form-section__wrap\">\n        <div class=\"l-heading-v6\">\n
