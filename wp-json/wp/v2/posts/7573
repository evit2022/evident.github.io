class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched by Google in November 2017, custom intent audiences was created for more accurate targeting of users who are researching topics and solutions by visiting certain pages and using specific keywords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this tool, <strong>you can reach users based on their most recent purchase intent, as well as those who are looking for your specific products or services. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As explained by <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/10075331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>\u201cCustom intent audiences help you define and reach the ideal audience for your business. Built with performance advertisers in mind, custom intent audiences allow you to go beyond pre\u2013defined audience categories and reach people as they\u2019re making a purchase decision.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>With custom intent audiences, you can reach your ideal users and target audience through display and video campaigns. You can also separate these audience groups into different segments, based on specific keywords and landing pages you wish to target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two types of custom intent audiences exist:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Audiences generated automatically by Google\u2019s machine learning algorithms<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do-it-yourself audiences that marketers can create on their own by inputting keywords and pages related to their products<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Looking to turn prospects into customers?

This is based on the content they search for and other behavioral signals.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Websites they browse that are similar to yours<\/strong>: This type of targeting reaches your ideal customers who browse websites similar to the URLs you input.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apps they use that are similar to yours<\/strong>: The names of the apps your ideal customers are using or may use is the main input here. With this targeting, your ads are reaching people who use apps related to or similar to those you enter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a brand that sells men\u2019s vintage fashion apparel can narrow down its audience by entering interest keywords such as \u201cvintage fashion,\u201d \u201cbespoke suits\u201d or \u201cgentleman lifestyle.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand could also use the URLs of websites with content on the high fashion history, luxurious destinations, fashion, culture and arts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When adding apps, this brand would likely tap into the Lifestyle category and look for the most popular and best-rated apps there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Audience Options Do Custom Intent Audiences Have?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With custom intent audiences, Google has streamlined its Display, Gmail, YouTube and Discovery campaign types and placed them under the same umbrella.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom intent and custom affinity audiences that you may have previously known as a marketer are now called custom audiences. You can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use audiences you created previously<\/strong>: When creating an audience for any type of campaign, you may opt for an audience that you created previously using the old custom intent or custom affinity interface. The Audience pane\u2019s \u201cBrowse\u201d section will show these existing audience options. Hovering over each will display what keywords they consist of.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Create new custom audiences<\/strong>: If you choose to create a new custom audience from scratch, you can input interest keywords that will, as we\u2019ve pointed out before, inform Google who your ads should target. You may also add specific search terms that will align with users who search for those or related terms.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Target audiences beyond keywords<\/strong>: Finally, you may want to opt for other targeting methods that include people who visit certain types of websites or use certain types of apps. Google will populate the estimated audience size as you add options to any section. Google\u2019s system will interpret signals such as campaign goals, keywords and bidding strategy to choose the target audience focused on consideration, performance and reach. These options help Google narrow down a specific audience, as it treats inputs as a list of criteria to choose from.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Need to boost your campaigns&#8217; performance?

This is especially useful for informational intent queries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit the pages that rank best: Getting to know the pages that users most frequently visit is the best way to understand their search intent and determine what kind of content they want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tip #2: Check The Ranking History Of Target Keywords<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you research keywords for the topic users search for, you need to <strong>consider the ranking history of the keyword, not just the present ranking. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because relying solely on the current ranking is judging it on a small timeframe. This keyword ranking may change and fluctuate in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to know how it behaved in the past to know how it will behave in the future. Frequent changes could alter your perception of the keyword\u2019s worth for user search intent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check the ranking history of a target keyword using tools like Ahrefs Keyword Explorer and determine whether:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>There are no ranking fluctuations<\/strong>: This shows that top-ranking keywords and pages have always been ranking good and that they are a good indicator of continuous search intent.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>There are fluctuations of some pages<\/strong>: Some of the top-ranking pages are a good indicator of search intent. The keywords they contain could be good to target, but your content has to align with the main intent behind them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>There are a lot of ranking fluctuations<\/strong>: This indicates that the search intent for these pages and keywords is always changing or that Google cannot fully understand the search intent. Avoid targeting these keywords because search intent for them is not clear.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tip #3: Align Your Content Type, Format And Angle With The Best-Performing Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve located a keyword with a clear search intent, you should analyze the search results for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content type<\/strong>: The kind of content in the search results that performs the best, which may be:\n<ul>\n<li>Blog posts<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Landing pages<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Product pages<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category pages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested in how blogs contribute to your SEO performance? Check out the video below by our Head of Content at Digital Silk, Emma Debeljak:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Blogging Benefits SEO\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/66NseuEURDU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for the most prominent type of content in the search results and align your own content with it. If blog posts are the most frequent type of content, then create blog posts; if it\u2019s landing pages, go for a landing page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content format<\/strong>: The layout of the top-ranking pages, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>List posts<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tutorials<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How-to guides<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reviews<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Comparisons<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the content type suggestion, follow the successful crowd when it comes to creating content. Identify the content format that constitutes the majority of results and align your content\u2019s format with that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content angle<\/strong>: The unique approach to the article and its selling point. It provides insight into what users value when making this particular search. Again, align your own content with the most frequent content angle because that indicates what your audience is most likely to gravitate toward.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\"
