It will depend on the level of commission and the level of trust. If you have a high level of commission, but a low level of trust, there\u2019s less chance that you are going to build a large network of affiliates.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from platforms where you can be promoted as an advertiser and reach hundreds of potential affiliates at once, <strong>the other option is to build an affiliate network on your own by hand-picking your partners<\/strong> and creating tailor-made offers and ads for their platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a highly effective tactic, but managing affiliates on a one-by-one basis can also be time-consuming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, one of the best practices is to give your affiliates exclusive promo codes or special offers. This will help them motivate their audience to buy from you and make your revenues grow faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"box-cta -bg -border -narrow lazy colors-inverted\"\n     data-bg=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Digital-marketing-agency-services-marketing-strategy-655x230.jpg\">\n\n\t        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-marketing-strategy\" class=\"box-cta__wrap\">\n    \n        <div class=\"box-cta__text-wrap\">\n            <div class=\"l-heading-v3\">\n                <div class=\"c-heading -h2\">\n                                            <span class=\"c-heading__pre\">YOU MAY ALSO LIKE<\/span>\n                    \n                                            <div class=\"c-heading__title\">Digital Marketing strategy Guide [+Template]<\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"box-cta__icon\">\n            <svg class=\"icon icon-lib-icon-arrow-right-big \"  aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#lib-icon-arrow-right-big\"><\/use><\/svg>        <\/div>\n\n            <\/a>\n    \n<\/div>\n\n\n<h3>How Much Does Affiliate Marketing Cost?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the platform, you\u2019ll have different fees to pay, in addition to the commission you pay affiliates, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A one-time platform setup fee<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A monthly subscription<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A portion of your sales as a platform fee<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So, with affiliate marketing, you pay affiliates that generate sales for you and you pay platform fees. This might be a $500 setup fee, a $3,000 monthly subscription fee or anything in between.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, affiliates can prove to be a worthwhile investment, because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You only pay affiliates when they sell<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The revenue growth can be seen almost immediately<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us quote our marketing director <strong>Madalin Durca<\/strong> once again:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>\u201cAffiliate marketing is based on a revenue-sharing model and it\u2019s a win-win solution. If someone promotes your products on their website and helps you make more sales, you reward them by sharing your profit with them.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, <strong>affiliate marketing provides a great ROI<\/strong> because you are not paying much out of pocket. Most of it is a small percentage of your revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, your revenue can be $1 million, out of which you paid $100,000 to affiliates. So, that\u2019s a clear 900% ROI right there.<\/p>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Request a consultation &#038; custom proposal for your project<\/span>\n                <a class=\"arrow-right black\" href=\"\/request-a-quote\/\"  rel=\"noopener\">\n            Request A Proposal        <\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>How To Track Affiliate Marketing Results<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main advantages of affiliate marketing is the possibility to track results and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/business-reputation-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">manage your reputation<\/a> and campaigns with data-backed decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you use an affiliate marketing platform<\/strong>, you\u2019ll have access to insights within the platform, so for each of the ads on your affiliates\u2019 websites you can track metrics such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The number of clicks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Actions performed<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The cost per action<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The revenue gained directly through an affiliate\u2019s link<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can also track everything in Google Analytics<\/strong> because each of your affiliates will have a unique URL parameter to show where the traffic is coming from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can You Hire An Agency To Help You?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Absolutely!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do it on your own if you want to, of course.

It\u2019s all about nurturing relationships and growing your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to start a campaign, <strong>you can discuss with an influencer<\/strong> whether you want them to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only mention your product(s) among other brands as a recommendation<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Talk exclusively about your product(s) in a post (image\/video and a long-form caption)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dedicate a series of posts and stories across channels and platforms to promote your brand<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The best practice<\/strong> is for influencers to be transparent and note when a particular post is part of a paid partnership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/a\/brandedcontentexpansion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paid Partnership<\/a> feature on Instagram comes in handy. This feature enables you to approve influencers as business partners. So, every time they tag your business in a Paid Partnership post, you\u2019ll be able to see reach, engagement rates and other insights related to that post.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether influencers openly say they are being paid for the promotion or they don\u2019t mention it at all, <strong>the influence they have on their followers can be a highly effective tactic for brand promotion<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why you should build lasting relationships with influencers to help them stay connected with your company and up to date with your new services, products and ideas. They are your third-party marketers, so keep them close to your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How To Spot An Influencer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no set rule that determines when someone is an influencer, but you can usually spot one based on the size of their followers. Typically,<strong> a person with 5,000+ followers on at least one social media platform can be considered an influencer.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are exceptions, of course, along with different influencer categories:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nano-influencers:<\/strong> Emerging online figures with 1,000-10,000 highly engaged followers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Micro-influencers:<\/strong> Individuals or brands with 10,000-100,000 followers and a strong community within a specific niche<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mid-level influencers:<\/strong> Individuals or brands with a base of 100,000-500,000 followers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Macro-influencers:<\/strong> Individuals and brands with 500,000-1,000,000 global followers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Celebrities:<\/strong> With a 1M+ follower base of a widely diverse audience on a global scale<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, promotions via celebrities with a multi-million fanbase have proven to be the least cost-effective solution because their audiences aren\u2019t as engaged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why <strong>many brands have moved their focus to micro-influencers<\/strong>, to leverage their strong communities and social influence in their field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> During the COVID-19 pandemic, many nano- and micro-influencers began supporting local small businesses, artisan shops and creative professionals \u2013 without being paid for it \u2013 which made their influence and credibility even stronger.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/affiliate-vs-influencer-marketing-influencer-categories.jpg\" alt=\"A custom image to show influencer categories by the number of followers\" class=\"wp-image-3128\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>How To Find The Best Influencers For Your Brand<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To decide whether someone is the right influencer for your brand will depend on many factors, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Whether their target audience matches yours<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The strength of their online community<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The level of impact they have on their audience<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Their audience engagement rate in the comments<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Whether they\u2019re collaborating with your competitors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides that, <strong>the best match will include influencers who align with your brand values<\/strong>, as well as with your campaign budget, goals and key performance indicators (KPIs).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is Influencer Marketing Worth The Investment?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The short answer is \u2013 <strong>it depends on your goals<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let\u2019s elaborate a bit and dive into the cost to find out whether or not it pays off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, you\u2019ll pay influencers <strong>a flat fee up front<\/strong> and the price will vary depending on their audience size and popularity, as well as the scope of the promotion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since <strong>you pay for getting visibility on influencers\u2019 channels, this tactic is excellent for brand building, but not for the immediate performance<\/strong>. The performance of influencers is typically hard to measure and evaluate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s one possible scenario:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A prospective customer sees an influencer\u2019s post about your products<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>They type your product name in Google to find out more<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>They continue to research and compare your product to competitors\u2019<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>They start following you on social media<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>They make their first purchase weeks later<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in this scenario, what started with an influencer\u2019s post did lead to a conversion eventually, but it\u2019s not something you can track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In another scenario<\/strong>, you may rake in $10,000 in revenue by the end of the campaign, but if you paid $20,000 to influencers, this would mean you actually lost money short term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that it also takes time to set everything up. <strong>The number of hours you\u2019ll need to invest in influencer marketing setup and relationship building<\/strong> will depend on how many influencers you are collaborating with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gains from influencer marketing don\u2019t come immediately. You need to invest both time and money, but <strong>the results you get in the long-term could be better than those from affiliate marketing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.voxfeed.com\/en\/brand-advocates-and-influencer-marketing-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">48%<\/a> of marketers say that ROI gained from influencer marketing is better than ROI gained from other marketing channels.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/affiliate-vs-influencer-marketing-stat-image.jpg\" alt=\"A custom image to show statistics about influencer marketing ROI\u00a0\" class=\"wp-image-3132\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Pros-Cons-Of-Influencer-Marketing\"><\/span>Pros &amp; Cons Of Influencer Marketing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s zoom out and take a look at an overview of the influencer marketing pros and cons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pros<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Influencer marketing can help you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Access targeted audiences:<\/strong> Partnering with influential online figures in a specific niche gives you access to carefully targeted audiences and lets you grow your base of potential customers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increase brand awareness:<\/strong> Even a simple brand shoutout coming from an influencer with thousands of followers can help people discover your products and start an interaction with your brand<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Build brand credibility:<\/strong> It\u2019s one thing to self-promote how amazing your products are, but when someone else says it \u2013 and that someone has a strong influence on a huge audience \u2013 it counts<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Expand to new markets:<\/strong> Influencers don\u2019t have to be in the same industry as you, so you can use influencer marketing to scale up your business, reach new markets and start working internationally<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Accomplish long-term goals:<\/strong> The biggest advantage of influencer marketing is building strong, lasting relationships that can help you accomplish your long-term goals<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cons<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The downsides of influencer marketing include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You can\u2019t measure the performance:<\/strong> Because you can\u2019t accurately track influencer marketing performance, you can\u2019t directly measure the success<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It takes longer to set up:<\/strong> Compared to affiliate marketing, influencer campaigns can take much more time to establish a partnership and start seeing sales growth<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It can be a costly solution:<\/strong> This is especially true if you want to partner with macro-influencers or celebrities, which may cost thousands of dollars for a single post<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/affiliate-vs-influencer-marketing-reasons-for-influencers.jpg\" alt=\"A custom mage to showcase 5 reasons for using influencer marketing\" class=\"wp-image-3131\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Affiliate-vs-Influencer-Marketing-The-Final-Verdict\"><\/span>Affiliate vs. Influencer Marketing: The Final Verdict<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we have a winner in this affiliate vs. influencer battle?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing is for sure \u2013 choosing between these tactics for your digital marketing efforts should be easier now that you understand <strong>how they work and what the advantages and disadvantages of each tactic are<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To wrap it all up, here is a final overview to help you make a well-informed, strategic decision about how these tactics can support your customer acquisition goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Influencer marketing is better for establishing brand credibility and increasing awareness, but if you want to see your revenues grow fast, then affiliate marketing is a better solution for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <strong>in both tactics, you need to nurture the channel<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to make a strategic decision and accomplish short-term and long-term goals, you should use both affiliate and influencer marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As our marketing director <strong>Madalin Durca<\/strong> concludes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>\u201cEvery channel you build creates more opportunities for your users to convert.
