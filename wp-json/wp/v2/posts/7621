Guides for (new) employees created in an innovative and creative way, whether printed or in video form, can contribute to the culture of the organization, make the employee proud to be part of the team and convey a strong message to the employee that they are indeed in the right place.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The best practice is to point out team values in job advertisements, so your candidates can know what you expect from them and what it means to you and your team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step #3: Showcase Your Company Culture<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to your company culture, ask yourself:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do I want candidates to perceive and experience my company as an employer?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Answering this question will help you emphasize important elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <strong>you may want your company to be perceived as:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A community of like-minded professionals who care about the environment and try to reduce their carbon footprint as much as possible<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A friendly, collaborative and inclusive organization with a remote-friendly culture and a high level of flexibility<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A company that prides itself in equally employing juniors and seniors to create a work environment where younger employees thrive through coaching and mentorship<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have your company culture defined, use all relevant points of contact with your target audience to speak directly to your ideal candidates and showcase your culture through job ads, job descriptions, company profiles and other assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of a target audience, that\u2019s exactly what the next step is about \u2013 <strong>defining your ideal candidates.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step #4: Identify Your Ideal Candidate Persona(s)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to communicate clearly to your ideal candidates is to know who they are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That\u2019s where a candidate persona comes in.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same as with your buyer personas, you\u2019ll want to be as specific as possible about your ideal candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are some of the questions to consider for your candidate persona(s):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Who do you primarily want to reach?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Where do they live (and is their location important to you)?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are they willing to relocate if needed?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What is their level of education?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What is their current income?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What is their desired income over the course of the next five years?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What are their best qualities? How are their organizational skills?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What online channels do they use most frequently?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What platforms do they use for a job search?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do they have a personal profile on job platforms?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the questions and answers will depend on your business, the position you\u2019re looking to fill and your expectations from potential candidates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step #5: Explain Employee Benefits &amp; Perks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Answering common candidate questions about employee perks and benefits is one of the most important components of your employer branding campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the pandemic-induced lockdowns and work-from-home (r)evolution, some of the most desired perks that companies offered included, for example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Employee recreation room<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Paid lunch and snacks<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fully stocked fridge<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Free on-site parking<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Company retreats once a year<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Local team building events<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Since many companies transitioned to a remote-only mode in 2020 and many more are managing globally distributed teams, benefits and perks have shifted, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Today, some of the most sought-after benefits include:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Health insurance<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The ability to work from home all the time<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cNo micro-management\u201d policy<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Well-organized internal communications<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Learning opportunities through online conferences<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>More flexibility with working hours<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mental health days off<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Extended parental leave<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Better stock\/equity options<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Redefined career development possibilities<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the perks and benefits your company is able to offer will depend on your abilities, possibilities and your company\u2019s flexibility, as well as other factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you offer, be sure to mention benefits and perks in job ads, company profiles on job platforms, your social media profiles, email communication with potential candidates or during interviews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally,<strong> this transparency will lead to bringing the best talent in to help you grow your brand.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step #6: Guide By Example<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To attract the best talent, not only do you need to describe and show your values, culture, benefits and perks, but you also need to have your leadership team in line with everything that your organization represents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, your executives will guide by example, showcasing the culture and implementing the values in their everyday work to encourage employees to do the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is this so important?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because any kind of malpractice can damage your employer brand reputation. And even the smallest stain on your brand public profile can repel job seekers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the statistics to keep in mind:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/research\/app\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2017\/01\/GD_Report_ReviewsMatterEmployerBrand_FINAL-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">95%<\/a> of candidates consider a company\u2019s reputation before they apply to a job offer<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pdfserver.amlaw.com\/cc\/COMMITForumPowerpointdocumentSeptember232013Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">69%<\/a> of candidates \u2013 even if unemployed \u2013 would reject an offer from a company with a bad reputation<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/about-us\/workplace-culture-over-salary\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">65%<\/a> of Millennials place company culture above salary when it comes to job satisfaction<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A minimum of a <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/03\/a-bad-reputation-costs-company-at-least-10-more-per-hire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10%<\/a> pay increase is what companies with a poor employer brand should offer to attract top talent<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Employers who fail to invest in their reputation could end up paying up to an additional <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/talent-solutions\/blog\/employer-brand\/2016\/research-shows-exactly-how-much-having-a-bad-employer-brand-will-cost-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">$4,723<\/a> per employee hired<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To be able to lead by example, your executives should also know this: <strong>diversity, inclusion, and belonging<\/strong> (DIBs) was among the most important principles for candidates during 2020, while <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/talent-solutions\/blog\/future-of-recruiting\/2020\/future-of-recruiting#prediction2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">77%<\/a> of HR specialists say diversity will be crucial to the future of recruiting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step #7: Optimize Candidate Experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Candidate experience is a candidate\u2019s overall perception of the company\u2019s recruiting process.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing the experience your potential candidates will have with your company means that you should streamline every stage of the recruitment process, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Job descriptions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Application process<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Email communication<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interviewing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hiring<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Onboarding<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the most of your recruitment efforts and leave candidates with a positive notion about your employer\u2019s brand, ensure that every recruitment phase is efficient, well-organized and that it reflects your values and company culture.<\/p>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Looking to optimize your application process?
