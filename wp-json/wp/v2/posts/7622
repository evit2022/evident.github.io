corporate brand is how you define your organization as a whole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On the other hand, corporate branding\u202fis building, promoting and growing your company\u2019s brand as a corporate entity.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s how your corporation presents itself to the world, as well as how you represent your corporation to your employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate branding is a <a title=\"6 Types Of Branding Strategies\" href=\"\/digital-trends\/types-of-branding-strategies\/#6-Types-Of-Branding-Strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">type of branding strategy<\/a> that\u2019s much broader than the scope of branding specific products or services separately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It involves integrating consistent branding with your marketing, communications and corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities to reach customers, investors and even employees.<\/p>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span

Let\u2019s look at three major benefits you can gain from corporate branding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-Define-Your-Personality\"><\/span>1. Define Your Personality<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate branding defines your brand\u2019s personality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What traits does your brand embody? Does it have a sense of humor like Wendy\u2019s or KFC? Or maybe your brand is vibrant and welcoming, or prestigious, focused on sustainability, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your target audience resonates with your company\u2019s personality and feels a connection with your brand, customer loyalty increases, which creates a great opportunity for increased sales as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-Create-Consistency-Across-Your-Offerings\"><\/span>2. Create Consistency Across Your Offerings<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate branding enables your brand to utilize a centralized and consistent marketing strategy across your offerings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you own a tech company, and you portray yourself as an innovative leader in the industry, but you\u2019re also focused on simplicity (hello, Apple)!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Implementing a corporate branding strategy allows you to brand each of your products in a similar method:<\/strong> simple (with a <a href=\"\/web-design\/minimalist-website-design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">minimalistic design<\/a>) yet innovative (including the latest tech innovations such as artificial intelligence for face recognition, if you offer mobile phones).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-Save-Time-And-Money\"><\/span>3. Save Time And Money<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlighting the previous point of consistency, corporate branding allows you to save time and money in your branding and marketing efforts. You won\u2019t have to create a brand-new game plan every time you launch a new product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"box-cta -bg -border -narrow lazy colors-inverted\"\n     data-bg=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Consulting-655x230.jpg\">\n\n\t        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/business-reputation-management%20\" class=\"box-cta__wrap\">\n    \n        <div class=\"box-cta__text-wrap\">\n            <div class=\"l-heading-v3\">\n                <div class=\"c-heading -h2\">\n                                            <span class=\"c-heading__pre\">YOU MAY ALSO LIKE<\/span>\n                    \n                                            <div class=\"c-heading__title\">Business Reputation Management 101<\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"box-cta__icon\">\n            <svg class=\"icon icon-lib-icon-arrow-right-big \"  aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#lib-icon-arrow-right-big\"><\/use><\/svg>        <\/div>\n\n            <\/a>\n    \n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-Successful-Corporate-Branding-Examples-Apple-Alphabet-SAP\"><\/span>3 Successful Corporate Branding Examples: Apple, Alphabet &amp; SAP<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before creating your corporate branding strategy, look for inspiration from the best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve compiled three examples of famous brands that turned their corporate branding efforts into highly successful campaigns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Example-1-Apple\"><\/span>Example #1: Apple<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is one of the best examples of a well-established corporate brand.

It is also about <strong>lifestyle, innovation, simplification and empowering people<\/strong> <strong>through technology.<\/strong> In short: It\u2019s high quality, high class, high tech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In their own words, taken from\u202f<a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/241783590\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Apple\u2019s ad \u201cIntention:\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>\u201cThe first thing we ask is: What do we want people to feel?

Corporate Values, Mission And Vision<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having clearly defined corporate values, plus a unique mission and vision, will help you lay a strong

to move your business in a different direction<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Identify the values that match your business development plans<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integrate the values important to your employees into your culture<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you define your values, incorporate them into your mission and vision statements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A mission statement<\/strong>\u202fdeclares the strategic direction towards accomplishing your long-term goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A vision statement\u202f<\/strong>declares the long-term goals you what to achieve and the ideals you strive to reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these statements should be clear and concise and help your employees, executives and stakeholders understand the purpose of your business and the values behind it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of Nike&#8217;s mission:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-6743 size-full\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\"

The best practice is to be specific when creating personas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Include demographic data, as well as values and opinions, buying habits, online platforms they spend the most time on, devices they use and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you have several different target audiences, create a buyer persona for each.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For example,<\/strong> if you run a SaaS business and your product is targeting both individual users and enterprises with large teams, make sure that you communicate the right messages to each audience segment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Digital Silk, <strong>we create buyer personas tailored for your target audience to identify their pain points and wants<\/strong>, and ultimately, provide a solution for your existing customer and prospects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step-4-Define-Your-Corporate-Brand-Voice\"><\/span>Step #4: Define Your Corporate Brand Voice<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important element of a corporate brand strategy is your corporate brand voice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are the key points to remember about your voice:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It needs to reflect your corporate brand values, identity and personality<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It needs to be consistent throughout your internal and external communications<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It needs to be in line with the voice of customers (VOC) and the audience you serve<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to define your brand voice is to\u202f<strong>establish your brand personality.<\/strong> In other words, identify a set of human characteristics that you can assign to your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start with these questions:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If your company was a person, who would it be?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What would that person care about the most?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How would that person behave in different situations?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is it a strictly professional or a funny individual?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What are the main strengths and weaknesses?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How would that person appear in public?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How would you want them to be perceived in public?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The best practice is to document your brand voice and create a well-organized voice style guide to ensure consistency in brand communication across all channels.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take <a href=\"https:\/\/styleguide.mailchimp.com\/voice-and-tone\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Mailchimp<\/a>&#8216;s brand voice guidelines:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>At Mailchimp, we\u2019ve walked in our customers&#8217; shoes, and we know marketing technology is a minefield of confusing terminology.

Keep it simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other brand messaging statements that you might want to craft include:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A slogan<\/strong> as a catchy, memorable line that helps attract loyal customers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A motto<\/strong> that describes your company\u2019s beliefs, values or services<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>An elevator pitch<\/strong> that describes your company in a clear, concise statement<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating unique taglines sets your brand apart from other businesses who provide similar products and highlights your brand\u2019s mission and vision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a recent commercial from Dunkin&#8217;, a famous donut chain.

should also <strong>outline the ways you will manage your reputation and maintain customer loyalty.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since digital channels enabled customers, vendors, partners,

keep track of when, where and how people talk about your brand<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensuring that information about your company is complete and accurate across profiles on business directories<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overseeing customer reviews and online ratings of your company and products\/services on rating platforms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Online customer reviews<\/strong>\u202fare still one of the most significant decision-making factors for prospective customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a

reviews on social media decreased their spending by\u202f12%\u202fand reduced their purchase frequency by 5% in relation to a given brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same study also found:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is a <strong>270% greater chance of purchase<\/strong>\u202ffor a product with five reviews compared to a product with no reviews<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The conversion rate for lower-priced products with displayed reviews increased by 190%, while <strong>the conversion rate for higher-priced products with reviews increased by 380%<\/strong><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reviews from verified buyers, as opposed to anonymous reviews,\u202f<strong>increase purchase likelihood by 15%<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know online customer reviews can influence buying decisions at such a rate,\u202f<strong>consider displaying positive reviews on your website, prioritizing verified reviews and generating reviews for higher-priced
