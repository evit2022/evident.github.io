It grows traffic, builds trust and increases customer retention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Updated content, page speed optimization and functional navigation<\/strong> are just a few of the factors that keep your prospects engaged with your website longer than with your competitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reason #5:&nbsp;Boost Sales<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website can make or break your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/web-design-stats-for-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">HubSpot<\/a>, <strong>90% of visitors leave a website they find unappealing.<\/strong> And as many as <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/loading-time\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">40%<\/a> of visitors leave a site that takes longer than three seconds to load.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes as little as a few seconds to lose a prospect due to a broken link, downtime or a slow loading page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ultimately affects your sales!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular website improvement can decrease bounce rates and lost revenues. All it takes is proper monitoring, data tracking and developing a solid plan to make your site more reliable.<\/p>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Need help with building a results-focused website?<\/span>\n                <a class=\"arrow-right black\" href=\"\/contact\/\"  rel=\"noopener\">\n            Set Up A Consultation        <\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7-Website-Issues-That-Might-Be-Affecting-Your-Site-Performance-And-Conversions\"><\/span>7 Website Issues That Might Be Affecting Your Site Performance And Conversions<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the most common problems that can affect your sales and website performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Website Issue #1: Slow-Loading Pages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>As page load time moves&nbsp; from one to ten seconds to load, brands may see a bounce rate increase of up to 123%<\/em><\/strong>. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/marketing-resources\/data-measurement\/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em>Think with Google<\/em><\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loading time is one of the most common reasons for immediate page abandonment. And when it comes to search engine rankings, <strong>every second counts.<\/strong> Some research suggests that page speed is one of the ranking factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s consumers want to spend less time finding the products and the information they need, which means they have very little to no patience for slow-loading sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why they can drastically decrease conversions and have you bleeding leads throughout your conversion funnel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid this, analyze every page on your website, see what slows them down and make the necessary fixes.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-2545\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-24-at-4.41.07-PM.png\" alt=\"Website speed issue\" class=\"wp-image-2545\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Source: Pingdom]<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>Website Issue #2: Unresponsive Design<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unresponsive design is a common website issue that affects user experience and pushes visitors away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s why:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/platform-market-share\/desktop-mobile-tablet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">StatCounter<\/a>, between April 2019 and April 2020, internet website traffic came via:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile (53.81%)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Desktop (43.27%)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tablet (2.92%)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words: <strong>Mobile has surpassed desktop web traffic.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your website does not work on mobile devices properly, expect to face high bounce rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more, mobile responsiveness is one of the signals Google\u2019s algorithm tracks. So, a static website will result in lower rankings.<\/p>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Schedule a consultation with our responsive web design experts<\/span>\n                <a class=\"arrow-right black\" href=\"\/contact\/\"  rel=\"noopener\">\n            Schedule A Consultation        <\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Website Issue #3:&nbsp;Clutter<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cluttered design forces website visitors to waste time searching for and processing information and trying to engage with your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can hurt your website performance in two ways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It ruins user experience because it inhibits visitors from finding what they are looking for<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the case of B2B buyers, even if it does manage to get a few points across to the researchers, it is likely to confuse and repel decision-makers with no patience for it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This ultimately results in poor engagement, higher bounce rates and fewer conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-2544\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-24-at-5.10.21-PM.png\" alt=\"Example of a cluttered website\" class=\"wp-image-2544\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Example of a cluttered website [Source: Arngren.net]<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>Website Issue #4:&nbsp;Broken Links<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While broken links may not seem like much on the surface, this common website issue can seriously affect:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SEO<\/strong>: 411 or 404 pages restrict the flow of link equity throughout your website. Once Google\u2019s crawlers track them, it may negatively impact your rankings because the search engine doesn\u2019t want to send users to sites that may provide them with poor user experience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reputation<\/strong>: Running into a broken link is a frustrating experience. These links prevent users from completing some desired tasks and accessing the information they need. This pushes visitors away and damages your business reputation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Revenue<\/strong>: Broken pages are roadblocks to the conversion process. Consumers don\u2019t trust companies that provide them with poor experience and they wouldn\u2019t buy from an untrustworthy brand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-2543\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-24-at-4.30.40-PM.png\" alt=\"apple's can't be found page\" class=\"wp-image-2543\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Source: Apple]<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>Website Issue #5: Hard-To-Find Contact Details<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the growing number of fake websites, which are sites posing as legitimate businesses with the purpose of extracting sensitive personal data, users can be quite suspicious when browsing the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hard-to-spot phone number, email address and business location can potentially cost you customers and sales for this very reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Website Issue #6: Lack Of CTAs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>HubSpot found that <strong>incorporating anchor CTAs in their content increased their conversion rate by 121%.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CTAs are a key ingredient in effective marketing. They reduce decision fatigue and guide visitors to take specific actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You publish content on your site with a purpose. Including compelling CTAs will ensure that each landing page or blog post is meaningful and fits into your overall marketing plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple CTA like \u201cClick here\u201d or \u201cBuy now\u201d can significantly increase click-through rates and conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Website Issue #7:&nbsp;Complex Navigation Menu<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your navigation menu is complex or unclear, your prospects may bounce and start another search for a website that will live up to their expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simple navigation can make all the difference<\/strong> in keeping users invested in your website. It saves them time, improves on-site experience and even helps facilitates the decision-making process by making key information easily accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Request a website audit &#038; custom proposal<\/span>\n                <a class=\"arrow-right black\" href=\"\/request-a-quote\/\"  rel=\"noopener\">\n            Request An Audit        <\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6-Website-Improvements-A-Web-Consultant-Can-Help-You-With\"><\/span>6 Website Improvements A Web Consultant Can Help You With<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A web consultant works closely with your in-house team, helps you discover website issues and assists you in fixing them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five ways a web consultant can help you make the necessary website improvements:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Website Improvement #1: Website Audit<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A website audit helps you analyze the current state of your site, find out what\u2019s working and what&#8217;s not and helps you discover discrepancies in data and compatibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an inevitable process for website improvement that will provide you with key data on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Content quality<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Responsiveness<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Loading times<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optimization<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A web consultant brings to the table the expertise and experience you need to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the right data to analyze and track<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Assess the current metrics<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ask the right questions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set realistic goals<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Identify impediments to performance<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Identify untapped opportunity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At Digital Silk, our experts use a comprehensive website audit to determine your website&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses, and identify areas for improvement. For example, check out our CEO&#8217;s website evaluation of two major streaming networks &#8211; Netflix and Hulu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Netflix vs Hulu Web Design Analysis and Comparison\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1oBb9lKVvMQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Website Improvement #2: Web Design And User Experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Web design and user experience go hand in hand. As we\u2019ve seen by now, these are <strong>strongly correlated with how users perceive the brand,<\/strong> influencing their decision to trust and engage with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From details like the psychology of color and font + browser compatibility, to more complex elements like wireframes and responsiveness, <strong>a web consultant will help you optimize your design for user engagement and conversions.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counting on the help of expert advice, you will be able to enhance:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Usability<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Aesthetics<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Visibility<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interaction<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Website Improvement #3: Web Development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website\u2019s backend is as important as your site\u2019s frontend. It contributes to a user-friendly content management system, easy navigation and site compatibility with various devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to backend development, a web consultant can help you with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Creating and managing the database<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choosing the right server technologies<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integrating cloud computing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Developing and managing a content management system<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Managing APIs resources<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Organizing backup files<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Website Improvement #4:&nbsp;Search Engine Optimization And Content Strategy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Organic search generates <a href=\"https:\/\/videos.brightedge.com\/research-report\/BrightEdge_ChannelReport2019_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">53%<\/a> of total website traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three tactics that stand out for an effective organic search strategy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>On-page SEO<\/strong>: This includes optimizing your content to allow search engines to understand its topic. Key factors to consider are keyword optimization, quality content and interlinking, among others.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Technical SEO<\/strong>: The strategies around technical SEO are not content-related and their aim is to improve the website\u2019s backend structure and foundation. They relate to mobile-friendliness, site speed, security and more.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Off-Site SEO<\/strong>: While not a website improvement tactic, per se, off-page SEO strategy contributes to website performance in search.
