What is the ROI you\u2019re expecting to achieve?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>How will your business accomplish these goals<\/strong>? What tools and tactics will you use to implement your marketing strategy?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>How will you measure the success of your business?<\/strong> What metrics will you measure in your B2B marketing efforts and what KPIs will your strategy include?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These questions are important to consider before developing your marketing plan. We\u2019ll touch upon them in greater detail later on in this article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, however, let us answer another fundamental question about business-to-business marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Need help with your B2B marketing strategy?

And the audience behind these organizations relies on a very different decision-making process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Decision-making process<\/strong>: While emotional appeals might work very well in B2C, they are not as suitable in B2B marketing. The key stakeholders in businesses and organizations are not motivated by emotional desires. Instead, they make logical, informed, financially-driven decisions &#8211; which brings us to the next aspect.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Purchase motivation<\/strong>: The end customers of B2C businesses purchase a product or service to satisfy a specific need that arises from an underlying want. B2B customers, on the other hand, usually make purchases that will improve their ROI or solve a business-specific problem.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Relationship longevity<\/strong>: In the B2C world, customers don\u2019t necessarily look to establish a long-term relationship with a business. And the B2C marketing practices reflect that. On the other hand, B2B customers usually wish to establish long-term relationships, often due to logistical and financial reasons. This is why your marketing strategy should focus not only on attracting new customers but also on retaining the existing ones.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Length of the buyer\u2019s journey<\/strong>: In B2B marketing, a prospective customer takes a lot more time to convert into an existing one than in B2C. This is due to the combination of the factors above: the slower, more logical decision-making process, the investment-driven purchase motivation and the wish to establish long-term partnerships.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/b2b-marketing-strategies-vs-b2c.jpg\" alt=\"b2b marketing strategies vs b2c\" class=\"wp-image-1528\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Developing-A-B2B-Marketing-Strategy-What-To-Consider\"><\/span>Developing A B2B Marketing Strategy: What To Consider?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before picking and developing a specific business-to-business marketing strategy, you should consider the following aspects of your business:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-Market-And-Audience\"><\/span>1. Market And Audience<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>B2C companies often cater to a wide range of customers across different market niches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, B2B companies usually focus more on a specific group of customers and a specific market niche. This is why you must define the target market and audience of your business as clearly as possible. The more you know your audience, the easier it will be for you to communicate with it effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-Objectives-And-Expectations\"><\/span>2.

(<a href=\"https:\/\/uxcam.com\/blog\/ux-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bluespace<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not exactly a strategy on its own but, rather, a prerequisite that is essential for any other strategy to work. Because the truth is, without a well-designed, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/website-improvement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">optimized website<\/a>, all your B2B digital marketing effort will go to waste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid that, simply ensure that your website meets the following criteria first:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your website is fast<\/strong>: The harsh truth is that <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/loading-time\/#:~:text=Facts%20and%20Stats%20to%20Tweet%3A&amp;text=47%25%20of%20consumers%20expect%20a,reduction%20in%20conversions.%20%C2%BBtweet%C2%AB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">40%<\/a> of visitors will abandon your website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. So make sure to optimize your website for minimal loading speed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Your website is mobile-friendly<\/strong>: Yes, this is not only important for B2C websites. According to BCG, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bcg.com\/publications\/2017\/marketing-sales-digital-go-to-market-transformation-mobile-marketing-new-b2b-buyer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">80%<\/a> of B2B buyers use their mobile devices for work. Moreover, 60% of them say that mobile browsing played a significant role in their purchase.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Your website is actionable<\/strong>: A converting B2B marketing website does not only substitute a fancy printed brochure. It doubles as a sales rep, too. So make sure that your visitors can contact you or request a proposal directly via your web page. Otherwise, <a href=\"https:\/\/komarketing.com\/files\/b2b-web-usability-report-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">44%<\/a> of them are likely to abandon it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Strategy-1-Content-Marketing\"><\/span>Strategy #1: Content Marketing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Over 40% of B2B marketers prioritized content marketing in 2020.<\/strong><\/em> (<a href=\"https:\/\/databox.com\/marketing-trends-in-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Databox<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, content ruled supreme in recent years and it will continue to do so in 2023. This is why we believe that focusing on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/content-marketing-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content marketing<\/a> will be a winning marketing strategy for you and your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are just a few reasons why content is such an effective, versatile strategy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It works at any stage of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/conversion-funnel-user-journey\">the conversion funnel<\/a><\/strong>: Whether you\u2019re looking to generate demand, generate leads, or retain your existing customers, there is a content piece for that. Content is one of the most effective ways to connect with your audience and keep it interested in your business.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It educates and guides your customers<\/strong>: Unlike many B2C customers, B2B buyers prefer to be as educated as possible about the product they are considering to purchase. And there is no better way to educate them than through content.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It\u2019s extremely flexible<\/strong>: Most B2B marketers associate content with blog posts and articles &#8211; and they wouldn\u2019t be wrong. However, there are so many different formats of it, such as podcasts, videos, infographics, case studies and so on. And because of this variety, you can tailor your content marketing strategy to the core competencies, needs and goals of your business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Strategy-2-PPC-Advertising\"><\/span>Strategy #2: PPC Advertising<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>75% of people say that paid search ads make it easier to find relevant information online.<\/strong> <\/em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/75-of-people-say-paid-search-ads-make-it-easier-to-find-information-300764873.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PR Newswire<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PPC advertising in B2B marketing is trickier than in B2C. The search volumes are smaller and the cost per click is higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, if executed correctly, PPC advertising could be an effective marketing strategy for the following reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It allows for narrow targeting:<\/strong> Remember how we said that you should outline your B2B audience as much as possible? PPC advertising makes it very easy.

Now, B2B marketers should follow along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video is one of the most consumed content formats on the Internet. It\u2019s only natural that it would find its way into the devices of your prospective and current clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s why a video B2B marketing strategy could be a way for you to reach them:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s the easiest way to get information<\/strong>: And B2B buyers love information! Just like content marketing, video marketing is a great way to not only inform and educate your prospective clients but also to entertain them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It\u2019s great for engagement<\/strong>: Customer engagement is something that\u2019s missing from other B2B marketing strategies.
