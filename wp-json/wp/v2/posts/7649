Challenges Of eCommerce To Anticipate When Designing Your Online Store<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Proper planning can help you anticipate challenges that lie ahead and prepare a solution for when they arise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to industry experts, here are the top challenges associated with an online store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>eCommerce Challenge #1: Conversion Rates<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a retailer who started with a brick-and-mortar store, you might find that running an eCommerce store is a bit of a different world, with its own set of challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that remains the same is the definition of conversion, which is the act of purchase for both your physical store and your e-store. Like your physical store, not everyone who lands on your website and beings browsing will actually convert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, conversion rates for your e-store are the number of people who actually purchase your product out of your total website visitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The challenge for first-time eCommerce retailers?<\/strong> They may get disappointed when they see their conversion rates at single digits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The solution:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be prepared for conversion rates to be lower than you hoped for:<\/strong> Believe it or not, 3% is the average conversion rate. But it also depends on other factors such as the market you\u2019re selling it in and the products or services you offer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Set your eCommerce website up to drive conversion:<\/strong> Key website elements like search engine optimization aimed at your target audience, messaging that builds a strategic conversion funnel and strong calls-to-action that define the user journey can help improve conversion rates for your website.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Looking to boost your eComerce store conversions? Speak with our experts<\/span>\n                <a class=\"arrow-right black\" href=\"\/contact\/\"  rel=\"noopener\">\n            Set Up A Consultation        <\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>eCommerce Challenge #2: Online Identity Verification<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While fraud may happen from time to time in a physical storefront, it\u2019s much more common in an eCommerce environment \u2013 especially if the payment process isn\u2019t secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Purchases made with a fake phone number, address or stolen payment information can result in a massive loss of revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how can you secure payment for your customers and avoid fraudulent transactions?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The solution:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look for signs of suspicious activity:<\/strong> Indications of fraud may include unusually high volume of orders or zip codes that do not match a state or a city. Always send an automated verification link for customers that sign up and purchase, to validate that the customer is genuine and the purchase is authentic.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use secure software solutions:<\/strong> Set up an eCommerce security solution to identify fraudulent attempts by using multi-layered authentication. These programs have features such as SSN verification, identity checks and instant authentication, making it possible for your eCommerce business to stay ahead of fraudsters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-6457\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/challenges-of-ecommerce-paypal.jpg\" alt=\"challenges of ecommerce PayPal\" class=\"wp-image-6457\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">PayPal offers an additional verification step to confirm your identity and to prevent hackers from gaining access to your account<br>[Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/us\/webapps\/mpp\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">PayPal<\/a>]<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>eCommerce Challenge #3: Consumer Expectations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a recent industry report, customer experience ranked as the top factor customers considered when purchasing from a brand, at the end of <a title=\"Industry report\" href=\"https:\/\/walkerinfo.com\/cxleader\/customers-2020-a-progress-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">2020<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does this mean? <strong>Consumers found customer experience more important than the price and even more important than the product itself.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today\u2019s oversaturated market, your product isn\u2019t the only thing that matters. Customers want more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>eCommerce giant, Amazon, for example, raised the consumer expectation game with their now renowned shipping system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How is an eCommerce brand to compete?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The solution:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integrate an order fulfillment process:<\/strong> A strategic process allows your business to receive and store inventory, process, pick, pack and ship your orders in a timely and well-structured manner that can result in higher customer satisfaction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consistently evaluate your service:<\/strong> Constantly assess your customer service by reviewing customer complaints and performing customer surveys. Update your processes and policies as needed to ensure you\u2019re meeting customer expectations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Establish customer connection:<\/strong> Ensure your customer feels valued and connected to your brand. You can establish this connection by sending personalized emails or text messages with product updates, shipping alerts, birthday messages and even \u201cWe miss you, here\u2019s a discount code\u201d notes to help improve customer retention.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-6466 size-full\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/challenges-of-ecommerce-bath-and-body-works.jpg\" alt=\"challenges of ecommerce bath and body works\" class=\"wp-image-6466\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bath &amp; Body Works raises the bar on customer experience and personalization by sending birthday discount codes to email subscribers<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">[Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bathandbodyworks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Bath &amp; Body Works<\/a>]<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>eCommerce Challenge #4: Customer Support<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While chatbots seem to have taken over the world, only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/717098\/worldwide-customer-chatbot-acceptance-by-industry\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">34%<\/a> of online shoppers worldwide are comfortable receiving customer service from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/nike-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">artificial intelligence<\/a> when shopping online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While chatbots are helpful for lead generation and are cost-efficient, artificial intelligence has yet to supersede the personalization customers receive from human support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The solution:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Utilize human touch:<\/strong> According to a study by American Express, <a title=\"American express study\" href=\"https:\/\/templatelab.com\/american-express-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">40%<\/a> of customers prefer talking to a human on the phone for more complex issues such as payment disputes. While offering automated customer service is convenient, customers still prefer to talk to a human agent when complex issues about money are involved, because they want immediate and accurate answers, unlike chatbots which offer a scripted and automated response.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gather feedback:<\/strong> Collecting feedback is important whether your customer support is human or robot. You can understand how your customers feel about your support team\u2019s performance when you send out customer satisfaction surveys after they experience support through calls, email or chat. Surveys will help you collect insights into the areas your support team can improve on. Use these insights to take action and continually improve your customer support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-6459\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/challenges-of-ecommerce-zendesk.jpg\" alt=\"challenges of eCommerce zendesk\" class=\"wp-image-6459\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Z Bot is Zendesk\u2019s chatbot<br>[Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zendesk.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Zendesk<\/a>]<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>eCommerce Challenge #5: Cybersecurity Issues<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyberattacks can compromise the security of your eCommerce website by infecting it with viruses and, even worse, they can compromise the security of your customers\u2019 sensitive data, which can damage your brand reputation and turn customers away for life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This scenario is one of the most significant issues to overcome in the eCommerce business and it is certainly one of the biggest nightmares of every eCommerce owner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The solution:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Manage your own servers:<\/strong> Ensure your eCommerce website is hosted on a standalone server dedicated only to you. Sharing the same space on one server with multiple other sites is risky; if some of those websites get hacked, the malware files may infect the entire server \u2013 including your store.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Backup your data regularly:<\/strong> Creating a backup of your entire database and all your files is essential in the eCommerce business. The general rule of thumb is, the bigger the website, the more often the backup should be performed. At Digital Silk, we run daily backups of all the websites we maintain.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Install security plugins and safety components:<\/strong> These are specially designed to prevent hack attacks. There is a great online market of security plugins for different systems and platforms that include firewalls, two-factor authentications and more.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Update your eCommerce platform regularly:<\/strong> Make sure you update your platform regularly with official patches, plugins and other software developed by its creators. Their teams work actively on identifying current threats and create solutions to stop them in their tracks.

When you buy supplies in bulk, you can save around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.magnifymoney.com\/blog\/news\/bulk-buying-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25%<\/a>!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prepare for seasonal shipping rates:<\/strong> From holidays such as Christmas and New Year\u2019s to weather conditions like ice and snow, freight availability can impact deliveries and shipping rates because of transport demand. Create a contract with your shipping partner to get consistent rates regardless of the season you\u2019re dealing with.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>eCommerce Challenge #7: Product Returns &amp; Refunds<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the growing demand of online sales, product returns present a challenge for eCommerce and online retailers since they are vulnerable to workforce inefficiency and worse, return fraud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Return fraud is when a customer purchases a product that is of good quality, uses it, but never intends to keep it. In exchange, the customer asks for a full retail price from the retailer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is: how can you give your customers peace of mind by knowing they can return products they aren\u2019t satisfied with, without potentially damaging your business through losses in shipment, revenue and reputation?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The solution:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be transparent about your return and refund policies:<\/strong> Ensure your customers can find detailed info on this very easily in your Terms &amp; Conditions, FAQ pages and even your checkout page, and make sure the policies are clear.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid imperative phrases in your policy wording:<\/strong> Phrases like \u201cyou are required\u201d and \u201cyou must\u201d can sound harsh and may intimidate customers.
