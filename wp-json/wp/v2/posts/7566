Read on to learn how some of the world\u2019s leading F&amp;B brands use apps to grow customer loyalty.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on efficiency and deliverability:<\/strong> With the average user spending no more than 14 seconds skimming through content and apps, make sure your customers get exactly what they want in the fastest possible time. This has an indirect effect on your revenue.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strive and allow for personalization:<\/strong> Personalization is the hallmark need of generations born Millennials and younger. Strive to create customizable and easily accessible digital solutions to build a highly engaged group of followers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Appeal to their emotions:<\/strong> Campaigns with a strong pathos, or in other words \u201cemotionally charged,\u201d are more relevant and appealing than ever before. A NerWallet study has found that 67% of millennials and Gen Z\u2019s claim to have overspent \u201cdue to emotions.\u201d So consider shifting your brand focus towards purpose-driven storytelling and campaigns.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reward loyalty:<\/strong> Nothing validates your client\u2019s commitment to your brand like rewarding them. An extra precaution here: Be authentic and transparent. Give out the rewards to influential, loyal or repeat customers without cutting corners or hidden terms &amp; conditions. Remember, your audience has instant access to present and archived information and is able to compare offers and rule out dishonest claims. So always be true to your word and win hearts with honest validation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"box-cta -bg -border -narrow lazy colors-inverted\"\n     data-bg=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Consulting-655x230.jpg\">\n\n\t        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/food-beverage-digital-trends\" class=\"box-cta__wrap\">\n    \n        <div class=\"box-cta__text-wrap\">\n            <div class=\"l-heading-v3\">\n                <div class=\"c-heading -h2\">\n                                            <span class=\"c-heading__pre\">YOU MAY ALSO LIKE<\/span>\n                    \n                                            <div class=\"c-heading__title\">Food &#038; Beverage Marketing [Top 12 Digital Strategies]<\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"box-cta__icon\">\n            <svg class=\"icon icon-lib-icon-arrow-right-big \"  aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#lib-icon-arrow-right-big\"><\/use><\/svg>        <\/div>\n\n            <\/a>\n    \n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How-The-Top-5-F-B-Brands-Use-Digital-Strategies-To-Increase-Customer-Loyalty\"><\/span>How The Top 5 F&amp;B Brands Use Digital Strategies To Increase Customer Loyalty<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-796 size-full\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/dominos-piece-of-the-pie-01.jpg\" alt=\"dominos - piece of the pie-01\" class=\"wp-image-796\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Source: Dominos]<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-Dominos-Piece-Of-The-Pie-Rewards\"><\/span>1.
