Doing Anything Without Clearly Defined Audiences<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>90% of companies using personas have been able to create a clearer understanding of their buyers.<\/strong> (Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itsma.com\/importance-of-developing-effective-personas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Itsma<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some business leaders, particularly first-time entrepreneurs and small business owners, believe that casting their net wide is a way of expanding the market and reaching more customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is: Only a few very specific groups will bring in most of a business\u2019 revenue, and \u201ccasting their net wide\u201d means neglecting these in favor of fickle possibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more, this approach inhibits them from developing a deep understanding of their actual prospects\u2019 interests, pain points and behavior patterns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing your customer is the foundation of every solid digital marketing strategy, so define your market and get to know the people you are selling to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to do so, as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.curata.com\/resources\/ebooks\/2016-CMStaffing-Tactics-Study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">63%<\/a> of marketers would recommend, is to create buyer personas for the two or three types of customers you identify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These will shape your strategies and reveal the channels to invest in for maximum return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To define your ideal customer:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Define buyer personas:<\/strong> Segment your market into a couple of distinctive \u2018customer types\u2019. Define them demographically, identify their pain points, their expectations and their possible objections to your offering.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hire experts for market research:<\/strong> Work with experts to develop a better understanding of your market and its changing habits and expectations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Talk to your prospects:<\/strong> Engage with them on social media through comments conversations, surveys, polls forums and elsewhere. Communicate with them directly and learn about your audience right from the source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/digital-marketing-mistakes-2.jpg\" alt=\"90% of companies using personas have been able to create a clearer understanding of their buyers\" class=\"wp-image-1540\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>2.

Describe how it can transform your buyer in a way they hope for and move them from the issue-ridden \u201cbefore\u201d state to the improved \u201cafter\u201d state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think hard about the offer you\u2019re making and the desired \u201cafter\u201d state. Articulate the journey from \u201cbefore\u201d to \u201cafter\u201d. The success of your digital marketing depends on the clarity of your offer\u2019s desired outcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can gain insight into your audience\u2019s pain points by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Analyzing their current situation through customer interviews, customer support cases and surveys.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Directly communicating with stakeholders, sales and support teams that are familiar with customers\u2019 requests.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Looking for third-party industry research on the shared pain points and taking note of the key findings to decide on your approach<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/digital-marketing-mistakes-3.jpg\" alt=\"Companies that provide good customer experience generate 4-8% higher revenue\" class=\"wp-image-1541\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.

Focus on those that have a search volume and for which you have realistic chances of ranking.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Quality content:<\/strong>&nbsp;Google and other search engines favor high-quality, relevant, long-form content that is well-researched. Add multimedia and visually rich elements such as videos to improve users\u2019 dwell time and engagement.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mobile-friendliness:<\/strong>&nbsp;Mobile has taken over the majority of internet traffic from desktop and whether your website is optimized for mobile is a strong SEO signal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Backlinks:<\/strong>&nbsp;Getting backlinks from authority domains and influencers in your field ranks you higher and appoints you as one of the authorities.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Image name optimization:<\/strong>&nbsp;Focus on the details such as neatly naming your image files, preferably to contain one of your keywords, as well as defining the alt tags.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>URLs:<\/strong>&nbsp;Use short and clear URLs that contain a primary keyword and describe the topic of the page are a great SEO signal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong>&nbsp;To stay on top of such a fast-evolving field as SEO, subscribe to updates by SEO authorities that are at the forefront of these developments and learn from them.

Users on Facebook differ from those on business-oriented LinkedIn and more lifestyle-oriented Instagram. Think in these terms:\n<ul>\n<li>Ask yourself which audience would respond better to your product or service. LinkedIn is great for marketing to other companies, Instagram for reaching young people and Facebook for selling directly to consumers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Study your competitors, which channels they use, who are their followers, what content they share.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Appoint a social media accounts manager:<\/strong> Social media managers can provide:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strategic thinking:<\/strong> Understanding how to come up with and present social media posts and how to engage with followers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Organizational skills:<\/strong> A step-by-step strategy that follows the specific schedule for posting.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/branding-agency\/\" title=\"Digital Branding Agency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Branding expertise<\/a>:<\/strong> Understanding your company\u2019s brand and providing the professional voice for it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Write, curate, listen and be consistent:<\/strong> Posts that educate, inspire and entertain should be your priority.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Team up with influencers:<\/strong> Through networking with influential people on social media you can gain further credibility, because 50% of buyers look for influencer reviews before buying a product.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Work on growing followers:<\/strong> Your business should work on organically boosting the number of followers on all social media channels that are relevant for the product or service.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engage with them:<\/strong> Responding to people\u2019s comments, communicating with them directly, conducting live video streams is a kind of personalization people expect on social media today.

There is already so much content out there and so many ads competing against each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you need to better position yourself in this ocean of competitive content &#8211; is to make sure your content is amazing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of making five blog posts per week, make one spectacular article, packed with case studies, data, visuals and other extras that raise its value and make people want to share it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some useful tips for creating content that will shift your focus from overproduction to quality work:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Monitor social media and Google:<\/strong> Pick up on industry topics and news that are trending. Use Google search results, search suggestions and \u201cPeople Also Ask\u201d as indicators of topics that are hot with your audience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use the Skyscraper technique:<\/strong> Locate a piece of content that is relevant for you and your audience and which is performing great. Make your own version of that &#8211; but make it even better, bigger, bolder, richer! That\u2019s the gist of skyscraping.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Remain specific to your niche:<\/strong> Don\u2019t go overboard trying to be an encyclopedia of everything. Stick to what you do and what you\u2019re great at and be very detailed about your topic.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Define the purpose of everything you make:<\/strong> Create a Contact page that is about people finding you quick and easy, About Us page that sums up what makes you different in your industry and so on.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use facts:<\/strong> Do your research and show credible numbers, backed by legitimate sources. This establishes you as a trustworthy authority.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Search engines also perpetuate the \u201cquality before quantity\u201d mantra. Google\u2019s officials have hinted at more sophisticated algorithms that will rank content according to its value, usability and quality.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/digital-marketing-mistakes-1.jpg\" alt=\"60% of all content produced does not deliver results\" class=\"wp-image-1539\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Bonus-Tip-How-To-Minimize-Online-Marketing-Strategy-Mistakes-By-Prioritizing-Digital-Marketing-Efforts\"><\/span>Bonus Tip: How To Minimize Online Marketing Strategy Mistakes By Prioritizing Digital Marketing Efforts<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyze your existing <a href=\"\/digital-marketing\/b2b-lead-generation\/\" title=\"B2B Lead Generation Agency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lead generation strategies<\/a>, marketing tactics and customer base:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Think about your successful, closed business deals.
