This stage, which even precedes the very existence of your business, is usually called the seed stage. You are about to plant your business seed and nurture it into success.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seed stage, however, also refers to seed funding. It is during this early period that entrepreneurs look for investors that will provide capital and financial support to their startup. This includes a high level of project feasibility research by prospective investors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking yourself whether your business idea will yield any profits and provide quick ROI is one of the core considerations of the seed funding stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Goal:<\/strong> Making an estimate of your idea&#8217;s business feasibility &#8211; that is, if it\u2019s worth developing into an actual business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenge<\/strong>: <span class=\"TextRun BCX8 SCXW84744374\" lang=\"EN\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun BCX8 SCXW84744374\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbinsights.com\/research\/startup-failure-reasons-top\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">42%<\/a> of startups fail due to a lack of demand for their products or services.

This will involve a great deal of market and economic research to establish the project feasibility.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Create a business plan:<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is always important to analyze and firmly establish the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats your business may encounter in the market you intend to enter.
