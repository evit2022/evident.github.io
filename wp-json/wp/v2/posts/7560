Provide Value To Your Audience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate goal of every piece of content you publish should be to provide real value to your target audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make that happen, follow these steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Research your audience and create an <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/personas-understanding-the-person-behind-the-visit#buildingPersonas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">archetype and a persona<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure you understand your audience\u2019s needs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Represent the solutions to those needs in your content ideas<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By tackling the right issues and <strong>adding value for readers<\/strong>, you can make sure that every piece of content you create is:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Relevant for your audience<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Informative and educational<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Well-researched and useful<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Personal and customizable<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Targeted at a specific segment of your audience, not everyone<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Better than other posts on a similar topic<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a documented content strategy, defined workflow and a clear action plan can help you stay on the right track and come up with the right ideas for your future articles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides that, try to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Allow ideas to flow freely:<\/strong> write them down and refine once you\u2019re done; Leave them to sit overnight and come back to them with a fresh pair of eyes and a regenerated mind<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stay organized<\/strong> and plan everything in advance<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Think of the content format:<\/strong> whether it\u2019s a round-up article, a how-to guide, a checklist, tips and tricks, a case study or in-depth research, plan what the content should look like<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Create a post-publishing plan<\/strong> for sharing content on social media and <a href=\"https:\/\/vocal.media\/journal\/design-rush-99-firms-and-more-the-untapped-marketing-potential-of-agency-rating-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">other spaces and platforms<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Optimize Existing Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As content comes in numerous forms, all of it can be reshaped into something else. E-mail campaigns can be turned into articles or marketing videos, the most engaging articles can be made into eBooks or presentations and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The options for repurposing content are limitless and there are usually two ways to go about it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimize existing articles to update and refresh them:<\/strong> you can either choose ones that are consistently well-ranked on Google to keep them engaging or you can find the articles that rank on pages 2-6 of Google search results, refine them and increase their chances of ranking higher<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Republish old content in a new format:<\/strong> find the most suitable formats for your target audience and repurpose existing content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyze your content with tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/analytics\/web\/provision\/#\/provision\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Analytics<\/a> to determine how your audience interacts with your site and what they like about it &#8211; especially which content pages are performing particularly well. This will help you determine what content to repurpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with finding the right content, using the best font is essential for better UI. So if you are looking to add stylish, vintage fonts to your websites choose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pixelo.net\/product\/best-tattoo-fonts\/\">tattoo fonts<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"box-cta -bg -border -narrow lazy colors-inverted\"\n     data-bg=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/website-strategies-1-655x230.jpg\">\n\n\t        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/website-strategies\" class=\"box-cta__wrap\">\n    \n        <div class=\"box-cta__text-wrap\">\n            <div class=\"l-heading-v3\">\n                <div class=\"c-heading -h2\">\n                                            <span class=\"c-heading__pre\">YOU MAY ALSO LIKE<\/span>\n                    \n                                            <div class=\"c-heading__title\">10 Website Strategies To Optimize Conversions<\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"box-cta__icon\">\n            <svg class=\"icon icon-lib-icon-arrow-right-big \"  aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#lib-icon-arrow-right-big\"><\/use><\/svg>        <\/div>\n\n            <\/a>\n    \n<\/div>\n\n\n<h3>4. Tell Your Personal Story<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider writing articles about your personal story. In fact, it&#8217;s highly recommended to do so. A post describing and explaining some personal struggles and triumphs can be a welcome addition to your blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find potential topics, reflect on your experiences, mistakes, doubts, realizations and successes. This will provide a humane dimension to your business &#8211; a story of trials and errors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can help you <strong>build trust and grow your credibility.<\/strong> It can also show your authentic, vulnerable side and encourage customers or clients to connect with you on a more profound level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Write About Your Business Struggles<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from your personal story, you can outline some of the issues and problems your business might be facing or faced in the past.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publishing an article on struggles you are facing may be of great help to fellow business owners who are in the same spot as you. Plus, it\u2019s a good topic to expand on: you can reminisce why you started your business, what has changed since, how are you looking to extend your business and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating new content for your site, solving your problems AND helping others. A triple win!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you choose to blog about, make sure it&#8217;s unique, valuable, engaging and insightful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the video below where our Digital Silk Head of Content explains how blogging benefits your SEO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How Blogging Benefits SEO\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/66NseuEURDU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Find-Article-Ideas-Using-Forums-And-Sourcing-Platforms\"><\/span>Find Article Ideas Using Forums And Sourcing Platforms<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>A well-researched, unique content idea and a blog post can<a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/2017\/10\/stats-invest-content-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> increase your traffic 3.5 times<\/a>!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the abundance of valuable information and an entire universe&#8217;s worth of content online, you don\u2019t have to feel obliged to reinvent the wheel when creating your own content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are online platforms and tools that can source and generate content strategies, topic titles, body text and everything else &#8211; if you know where to look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You only need to conduct thorough research and <strong>apply the skyscraper method when creating your own article<\/strong> &#8211; because you do want to outdo your competitors, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the list of some of the most successful and abundant content idea generators.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-2513 size-full\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/BuzzSUmo-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"BuzzSumo keyword results example screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-2513\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Source: BuzzSumo]<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>1.

Once you have a list of potential topics, create brief outlines, schedule publishing dates and start writing. Good luck!<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"form-section -wide -border colors-inverted\">\n    <div class=\"form-section__wrap\">\n        <div class=\"l-heading-v6\">\n            <div class=\"c-heading -h2\">\n                                    <div class=\"c-heading__title\">\n                        Request A Quote For Your Content Strategy                    <\/div>\n                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n                    <div class=\"text-big\">\n                <span>Tell us about your goals and let our experts give you recommendations and a custom proposal.<\/span>\n            <\/div>\n        \n                    <div class=\"l-form c-form\">\n                \n<div class=\"wpcf7 no-js\" id=\"wpcf7-f811-o1\" lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"><p role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><\/p> <ul><\/ul><\/div>\n<form action=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7560#wpcf7-f811-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form init\" aria-label=\"Contact form\" novalidate=\"novalidate\" data-status=\"init\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"811\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"5.7.3\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en_US\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f811-o1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_posted_data_hash\" value=\"\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"form-row two-cols\">\n   <div class=\"form-item\"><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"firstname\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"64\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-required ic-name\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Name*\" value=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n   <div class=\"form-item\"><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"company\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"64\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-required ic-phone\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Company Name*\" value=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"company\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"form-row two-cols\">\n   <div class=\"form-item\"><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"email\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"64\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-email wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-validates-as-email ic-email\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Email*\" value=\"\" type=\"email\" name=\"email\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n   <div class=\"form-item\"><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"phone\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"14\" minlength=\"6\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-tel wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-validates-as-tel ic-phone\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Phone*\" value=\"\" type=\"tel\" name=\"phone\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"form-row\">\n    <div class=\"form-item\"><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"message\"><textarea cols=\"40\" rows=\"10\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-textarea wpcf7-validates-as-required ic-message\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Your Message*\" name=\"message\"><\/textarea><\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"ds-lead-fields\">\n        \t\t\t<input name=\"source\" value=\"\" type=\"hidden\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<input name=\"utm_campaign\" value=\"\" type=\"hidden\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<input name=\"utm_source\" value=\"\" type=\"hidden\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<input name=\"utm_medium\" value=\"\" type=\"hidden\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<input name=\"utm_term\" value=\"\" type=\"hidden\">\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"quote-bottom\">\n    <div class=\"c-block__btn c-btn-bar\"><button class=\"wpcf7-submit c-btn -opacity\">SUBMIT<\/button><\/div>\n<\/div><p style=\"display: none !important;\"><label>&#916;<textarea name=\"_wpcf7_ak_hp_textarea\" cols=\"45\" rows=\"8\" maxlength=\"100\"><\/textarea><\/label><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"ak_js_1\" name=\"_wpcf7_ak_js\" value=\"182\"\/><script>document.getElementById( \"ak_js_1\" ).setAttribute( \"value\", ( new Date() ).getTime() );<\/script><\/p><div class=\"ds-refer-fields\">\n            <input name=\"page\" value=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7560\" type=\"hidden\" \/>\n            <input name=\"referrer\" value=\"\" type=\"hidden\">\n        <\/div><div class=\"wpcf7-response-output\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/div>\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coming up with creative content ideas on a regular basis is not an easy task, but it\u2019s essential for traffic growth and Google rankings.
