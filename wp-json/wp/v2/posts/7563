are likely to be interested in your products or services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The key to success<\/strong> is to attract and engage decision-makers who closely fit your buyer persona(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead generation is part of a digital marketing strategy, but it can also be a valuable element of your overall business strategy, as well as your website development process, email automation, SEO, content strategy, sales growth and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What-Does-An-Effective-B2B-Lead-Generation-Process-Include\"><\/span>What Does An Effective B2B Lead Generation Process Include?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from attracting new leads, you need to start a conversation and encourage prospective buyers to take your products\/services into consideration and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 turn into a customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead generation can consist of outbound and inbound techniques.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A typical outbound B2B lead generation process includes:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Defining a buyer persona as an avatar of your ideal customer<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Identifying companies that could benefit from your products or services<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Identifying decision-makers within those companies as your qualified leads<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contacting the leads via a cold email outreach, LinkedIn InMail, social media direct messages, cold calls or any other form of contact<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Presenting your offer directly to leads (or replying to their inquiries) and encouraging them to sign up for a trial or book an initial call with your strategist or a sales rep<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An inbound process can include generating B2B leads with:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A highly functional, helpful and optimized website<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Attractive, engaging and compelling landing pages<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blog posts, case studies or downloadable reports<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Conversations led through your chatbot<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>SEO techniques you use to rank higher in search

Instagram Story or Facebook Live video you broadcast<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that lead generation is not a single campaign, one marketing technique or a specific social media ad. It\u2019s a process and it can include marketing strategies you perform even if you don\u2019t specifically design them to generate leads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process can also depend on your business and the industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To tackle the most efficient strategies you could use for your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/branding-agency\/b2b-branding-agency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">B2B company<\/a>, we split our list into three categories: general B2B lead generation strategies, lead gen tactics for B2B service businesses and lead gen techniques for B2B tech brands.<\/p>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Request a consultation with our B2B lead generation experts<\/span>\n                <a class=\"arrow-right black\" href=\"\/contact\/\"  rel=\"noopener\">\n            Set Up A Consultation        <\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Before-You-Start-Optimize-Your-Website-For-Lead-Generation\"><\/span>Before You Start: Optimize Your Website For Lead Generation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a well-designed, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/website-improvement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">optimized website<\/a>, all your lead generation and digital marketing efforts will go to waste.

Content Marketing: Attract And Educate Leads<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Over <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/B2B_2022_Research.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">70%<\/a><\/strong> <strong><em>of B2B marketers attribute their success to the value provided by their content.&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content you publish and distribute across channels is a representation of your brand, so focusing on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/content-marketing-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">content marketing<\/a> to attract your target audience can be a winning strategy for your business, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are just a few reasons why content is such an effective, versatile strategy for lead generation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It works at any stage of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/conversion-funnel-user-journey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conversion funnel<\/a>:<\/strong> Whether you\u2019re looking to generate leads or retain existing customers, there is a content piece for that. Content is one of the most effective ways to connect with your audience and keep prospects interested in your business.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It educates and guides your customers:<\/strong> B2B buyers prefer to be as educated as possible about the product they are considering to purchase. And there is no better way to educate them than through content.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It\u2019s extremely flexible:<\/strong> Most B2B marketers associate content with blog posts, but there are so many different formats of content, such as podcasts, videos, infographics, case studies and so on. Because of this variety, you can tailor your content strategy to the core competencies of your business and the needs and goals of your audience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your industry and expertise, you could use content marketing to attract, engage and educate leads with blog posts, case studies, white papers, industry reports, scientific studies, podcasts, interviews, presentations, tutorials, masterclasses, webinars, conferences and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"box-cta -bg -border -narrow lazy colors-inverted\"\n     data-bg=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Digital-Lead-Gen-Strategies-for-B2B-Tech-Companies-01-655x230.jpg\">\n\n\t        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/b2b-tech-marketing\" class=\"box-cta__wrap\">\n    \n        <div class=\"box-cta__text-wrap\">\n            <div class=\"l-heading-v3\">\n                <div class=\"c-heading -h2\">\n                                            <span class=\"c-heading__pre\">You May Also Like<\/span>\n                    \n                                            <div class=\"c-heading__title\">Top 5 B2B Lead Generation Strategies For Tech Companies<\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"box-cta__icon\">\n            <svg class=\"icon icon-lib-icon-arrow-right-big \"  aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#lib-icon-arrow-right-big\"><\/use><\/svg>        <\/div>\n\n            <\/a>\n    \n<\/div>\n\n\n<h3>2. PPC Advertising: Place Your Offer In Front Of Your Leads<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>PPC advertising in B2B marketing is trickier than in B2C. The search volumes are smaller and the cost per click is higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, if executed correctly, PPC advertising could be an effective lead generation strategy for the following reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It allows for narrow targeting:<\/strong> The more you know about your target audience, the better targeted campaigns you can create. PPC advertising makes this easier for you. Thanks to the countless targeting options, you can make sure that your ads will reach your ideal customers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It\u2019s cost-effective:<\/strong> To this day, PPC advertising remains one of the most affordable and cost-effective B2B digital marketing options. The average Search PPC rate for the B2B market is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2016\/02\/29\/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$3.33<\/a>, which is far from the highest rates ($6.75 for legal services).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It\u2019s easily scalable:<\/strong> PPC advertising provides the most flexibility whenever you need to scale your business-to-business marketing campaign up or down. You can regulate your short-term and long-term spending with only a few clicks \u2013 which is very convenient in the dynamic B2B market.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>PPC ads are great for generating more leads because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>PPC traffic has a <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/ugc\/true-or-false-organic-traffic-converts-better-than-ppc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">50%<\/a> higher conversion rate than organic traffic<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>General stats for PPC in B2B state that the average CTR is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/linkedin\/linkedin-hashtags-now-bestfriends-01647927#xMZHCJS9lQZhx2a5.97\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2.41%<\/a> and that 65% of companies are acquiring B2B customers through LinkedIn paid ads<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>In total, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.formstack.com\/resources\/report-lead-capture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">78%<\/a> of marketers advertise on Google Ads and social media while LinkedIn has 14.6% of the PPC market share<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of what\u2019s in store for PPC in 2023, when it comes to B2B lead generation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:<\/strong> Machine learning can help you identify the bids that drive the most traffic, can predict the CTR of ads and how successful they will be in obtaining quality leads.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>PPC Automation:<\/strong> Automation can help you target the optimal demographics for every ad campaign and potentially cut down advertising expenses.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Video Marketing: Easily Engage Your Leads<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightcove.com\/en\/resources\/downloads\/reports\/find-out-why-b2b-buyers-turn-to-video-before-they-buy-anything\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">95%<\/a> of B2B buyers say video plays a crucial role in their purchase decision.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>B2C marketers have already embraced video marketing as one of the strategies with the most potential. Now, B2B marketers should follow along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video is one of the most consumed content formats on the internet. It\u2019s only natural that it would find its way into the devices of your prospective and current clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s why a video B2B marketing strategy could be a way for you to reach potential buyers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s the easiest way to get information:<\/strong> B2B buyers love information! Just like content marketing, video marketing is a great way to not only inform and educate your leads but also to entertain them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It\u2019s great for engagement:<\/strong> Engagement is something that\u2019s missing from other B2B marketing strategies. And that\u2019s a shame because just like B2C customers, B2B buyers would love to engage with their peers over a nice piece of presentation, webinar or other content. Video is a great way of achieving that.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It\u2019s versatile:<\/strong> Scroll through the first page of YouTube and see how many different video formats there are. \u201cHow to\u201d guides, \u201cBest of\u201d roundups or even simple updates. The good news is all those formats are suitable for business-to-business marketing, too.

Social Media Marketing: Encourage Faster Purchasing Decisions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with LinkedIn leading the way, you shouldn\u2019t neglect other social media channels because <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/sales-solutions\/social-selling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">75%<\/a> of B2B buyers use social media to make purchasing decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other channels may be tricky to master for something other than brand awareness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, there are a few key benefits that set social media marketing apart from other B2B lead generation strategies:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s an easy way to get exposure:<\/strong> Ask yourself \u2013 have you ever looked up whether a certain company was on Instagram? An established social media presence is one of the easiest ways to put your company and your brand out there. And B2B scroll as much as everyone else.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It gives your brand personality:<\/strong> One of the key elements of establishing a connection with your target audience is being relatable. Truth is, there is a human face behind every B2B company. Social media is a great tool for you to show yours to the world. Plus, engage your subject matter experts (SMEs) and make them a personification of your brand to grow your credibility and trust.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It\u2019s great for sharing your content:<\/strong> Out of all B2B marketing strategies, social media marketing is the one that compliments content marketing the most. Blog posts and visual content are easily shareable for you and easily accessible for your audience on social media.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media B2B trends that are expected to take over in 2023 are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Using closed groups<\/strong> and engaged communities to cultivate interactions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Micro-influencers<\/strong> and word-of-mouth marketing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Blending marketing and sales<\/strong> on social media for lead nurturing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>6.

Lead Magnets: Thought Leadership Can Do Wonders<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A lead magnet is a value-rich incentive you offer prospects in exchange for their contact information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the most out of it, don\u2019t create something your potential clients can find elsewhere. <strong>It should be something based specifically on your expertise, study, insights, research, knowledge, experience, etc.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lead magnet can be downloadable:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Checklist<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>E-book<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Case study<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Template<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Report<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>White paper<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Guide<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Slide deck<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is not exhaustive, of course.
