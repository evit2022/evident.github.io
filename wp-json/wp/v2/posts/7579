Fierce Competition<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For startup businesses, competition is one of the biggest challenges and threats to their very survival.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This especially goes for online businesses where the competitive corporate environment allows no margin of error.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both B2C and B2B startups feel the pressure coming from their numerous competitors, a good deal of which are already established names on the market.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><b>What to focus on:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Play aggressively: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both digitally native and traditional startups must punch above their weight to survive this competitive onslaught &#8211; which means taking on big projects and directly competing against the opposition that outweights them. This will gain them recognition they sorely need at this stage as well as the respect from similar expanding businesses.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>Build on your strengths: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try not to focus so much on your competitors and make yourself the center of your attention. Your offering should offer more value than your competition, such as competitive rates, better quality or unique benefits. Finding your product\u2019s edge and making the most of it is often the difference between success and business failure.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-Recruiting-The-Right-People\"><\/span>2. Recruiting The Right People<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After making the first several hires &#8211; usually, these are the people who start the entire enterprise &#8211; startup companies often face difficulties finding and attracting skilled people.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike the original employees, who were willing to work long hours for smaller wages in exchange for exciting and potentially highly rewarding business experience, new hires are not eager to take on the same sacrifice.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most skilled candidates were already through it all with some previous startup companies they worked with and know what risks and pressure they would be facing with your startup.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, they are not as willing to go back to working under such circumstances, potentially with certain budget limitations.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>What to focus on:<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Forge a healthy business culture:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To expand their team successfully, startups should present an impactful vision of themselves, their mission and their differentiator values to employees and candidates in order to hire the best individuals in the business.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>Name your desired outcomes: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When recruiting people for a startup, map out the desired outcome instead of looking to hire specific titles. Think in terms of immediate actions that will have the biggest impact towards achieving a certain goal. Also, think about which aspect of the business will benefit from someone taking over. Hiring \u201cthe best fit\u201d is dependent upon matching candidates to your most pressing objectives.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>Create a powerful job description:<\/b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you establish your startup\u2019s core values, competencies and tasks, you should create an attractive, self-explanatory job description for a needed team member. When doing that, ask yourself what tasks will this person be responsible for achieving that goal before emphasizing the most attractive aspect of the position.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-Cash-Flow-And-Financial-Management\"><\/span>3. Cash Flow And Financial Management<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When income increases, costs and expenditures also increase. Financial management is one of the most severe challenges startup businesses face, because money begets money.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investors are very important for startups because they often rely on their financial support and backup. These small, new enterprises usually find it hard to manage their finances when there is a cash influx.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, relying on investors is a fickle and potentially hazardous tactic. With a bit of advance planning and careful focusing, you can achieve good financial management on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>What to focus on:<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Play it safe and reach out to financial experts: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address the cash flow situation in the most painless way possible, startups should be cautious and ask for help from financial consultancy experts that can help in managing their finances.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>Manage your costs: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Startup owners should keep financial statements about their income and expenditures and know, in great detail, all about<\/span><\/b>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The income statement, which contains the revenue made in a specific period<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow statement, which is the analysis of investment and operating activities<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statements of shareholders\u2019 equity &#8211; the funds your business gets through common shares<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balance sheet, which reflects shareholders\u2019 equity and company assets<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>Plan your taxes:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taxes are a fact of life and your business can run effectively if you understand and plan them. Take a deep look into your expenditures, purchases and timing of revenues to save money and reduce tax liabilities. To master taxes, your business must:<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a bookkeeping system<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain a relationship with a reliable accountant<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not mix up personal and company transactions and accounts<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a retirement option that is tax-deductible<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-Winning-Customers-Trust-And-Loyalty\"><\/span>4. Winning Customers\u2019 Trust And Loyalty<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For new startup businesses, attaining customers and their trust is one of the most challenging obstacles. Their brand and the quality of their products and services are all unknown to wider demographics.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winning customers\u2019 trust and creating a base of loyal customers is vital for scaling and growing. It is no overstatement that customers really are the decisive factor and the driving force behind any startup\u2019s success or failure.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through their customers\u2019 social media activity or simple word-of-mouth, startups can gain a fair advantage over other competitive businesses &#8211; if they form strong bonds with their audience.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>What to focus on:<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Implement a customer-centric philosophy: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the startup\u2019s employees should be on the same page that customer is the king and that customer\u2019s loyalty and trust are crucial for attaining sustainable growth and company progress.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>Create a social purpose for yourself:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Today\u2019s customers value brands that show social responsibility and purpose. Your social conscience must come across as authentic and caring. Modern brands are much more than just selling products and services &#8211; they partake in social life and build a better community.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><b>Find ways to share profits: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving away shopper credits and points your customers can use later are a good way of sharing a part of your profits with your audience. This sharing approach helps build a loyal customer base and increase turnover.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Need business growth advice for your startup?<\/span>\n                <a class=\"arrow-right black\" href=\"\/contact\/\"  rel=\"noopener\">\n            Set Up A Consultation        <\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Growing-A-Small-Business-Key-Challenges-And-Muscles-To-Build\"><\/span>Growing A Small Business: Key Challenges And Muscles To Build<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small enterprises that are past their startup phase encounter new obstacles during their next stage in the life-cycle. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These challenges can pose a threat to their very survival if not treated methodically. But if overcome, SMEs can gain plenty of organizational strength and experience they can thrive on in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-The-Question-Of-Growth-vs-Quality\"><\/span>1. The Question Of Growth vs. Quality<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a small business grows beyond expectations and product and service production needs to increase to meet the demand, business owners and decision-makers may find themselves in hot water.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a business does not have adequate processes and mechanisms to handle this situation, it may fall short of growing demands. This may affect the quality of products or services and that\u2019s when growth can become an issue and adversity. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These failures to answer to growth challenges leading to a decline in quality often stem from the excessive personal engagement and obsessive attention to detail. Simply put, decision-makers\u2019 and owners\u2019 habits hinder the company\u2019s growth.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>What to focus on:&nbsp;<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Sacrifice in order to scale: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to scale up the small business so as not to sacrifice the quality of products or services that initiated the growth in the first place. The sacrifice in this means not personally managing every client relationship or not inspecting every hook and turn in the production process. Owners must navigate the small business\u2019s process to a compromise that allows scaling the brand.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-Dependence-On-A-Small-Number-Of-Clients\"><\/span>2. Dependence On A Small Number Of Clients<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small businesses that only have one or few clients that make up their income risk severe consequences in the event these clients decide to unexpectedly cancel their contract.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This scenario just might work if a client has a constant need for your services, but that is always subject to change. It is better for a small business to have a diverse base of clients that can pick up the slack in case one of them leaves.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To diversify a client base means to grow your business. However, for businesses that aren\u2019t yet a household name, finding new customers can be a challenge.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when they do find clients, it is doubly important that they pay on time for a product or a service.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If, on your list of clients, there is a single client who is responsible for more than half of your income, you should either generate more clients or make a better deal for the said clients.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Letting a small business rely on just one client is a potential disaster for a company.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>What to focus on:<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Spread the word to the right people: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should have a clear overview of who your target clients are, what they look like and what their buyer persona is.
