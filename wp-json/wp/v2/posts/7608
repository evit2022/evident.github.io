Now, they\u2019re up against influencers, platforms and general online content. They have to keep up with everything that is happening in order to retain users\u2019 attention. Traditional branding gave way to the digital-first <a href=\"\/why-brand-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">branding strategy<\/a>. Consumers perceive any brand through how they prioritize and build their online reputation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/brand-strategy-digital-revolution-quote.jpg\" alt=\"We are witnessing a digital revolution of user behavior and only brands that embrace all of its challenges and innovations will be in a position to grow.\" class=\"wp-image-2580\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>Bonus Tip: Create A Brand Architecture To Consolidate Multiple Brands Under The Same Umbrella<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies that have grown over the years often consist of old and new brands that all have their own brand identities. This multitude of brands under the same umbrella may confuse and even repel potential customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brand architecture<\/strong> is a system of organizing different subsections of a larger brand \u2013 such as subbrands, products and services \u2013 to help the target audience relate to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Google is a master brand of subbrands such as Gmail, GDrive and Google Meet, while P&amp;G is a master brand of subbrands such as Gilette, Pampers and Tide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand architecture clarifies the organization and relation between subbrands as a part of a larger whole, allowing consumers to understand the nuances of each brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also helps business managers and marketers know how and when to keep parts of a brand separate when needed versus when to have them work together to boost one another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand architecture begins with these two categories:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Master brand<\/strong>: A top-level brand that envelops all other brands, products and services<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brand extension<\/strong>: A brand, product or service launched by a known brand name belonging in a different category<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common brand architecture types are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Branded house<\/strong>: The master brand is always present and is linked to brand extensions. For example, Google is a master brand with brand extensions such as Gmail, Maps, GDrive and others, which provide different and complimentary services, easily linked back to Google.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>House of brands<\/strong>: The master brand is insulated from brand extensions. House of brands \u201cprotects\u201d brands from each other and encompasses competing brands in the same segments. For example: Unilever houses brands such as Dove, Rexona, Sunsilk, Knorr and Lipton, which all have distinctive identities and some of them even compete in the same segment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Endorsing brand<\/strong>: This is a more flexible way of placing subbrands under a master brand umbrella. Brand extensions have their own separate identities and may or may not be associated with the master brand depending on the context. Every subbrand has its own brand strategy but can use the master brand\u2019s equity. An example is Apple with its subbrands iPad, iPhone and Apple Pay.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why is brand architecture such a good brand strategy for growing businesses?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it brings these benefits to your company:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marketplace clarity<\/strong>: Brand architecture emphasizes the connection multiple brand extensions form through a consistent verbal and visual identity. This results in greater market visibility and stakeholder confidence.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attention-grabbing story<\/strong>: When multiple brands are consolidated, you are given an opportunity to tell why you have created your company, what unites these brands and what capabilities you have developed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cross-selling revenue<\/strong>: When you are able to express the full value of every brand you own and how they complement each other, it becomes much easier to cross-sell these combined solutions to consumers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Inclusive culture<\/strong>: A compelling, unified story can serve as a rallying cry for all your employees \u2014 one that makes everyone in various business units and locations feel like they\u2019re all fighting for the same cause.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a detailed look into using a brand strategy to communicate with all of these segments in a way that benefits your business.<\/p>\n\n\n<div

class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leads are more likely to trust a company in the future and become loyal customers if they know what to expect from the brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of lead onboarding begins from the first contact with the customer and continues until they are able to make an informed decision about your brand and its products or services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may consist of detailed step-by-step instructions, tutorials, guidance and support with the aim of helping leads understand how your brand solves their pain points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A brand strategy for communicating with leads should consist of these steps:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Train your sales team on your brand values, including your

how to train chatbots to use a consistent brand voice?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out these examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spotify<\/strong>: This streaming service\u2019s Facebook
