Fewer people will remain interested in your offerings and consider converting.

The content in the top of the conversion funnel should be:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Educational: talk about topics that interest your customers and educate them &#8211; convey the image of authority on the given subject<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full of understanding for your customers&#8217; needs: talk about the customer needs and empathize with your audience, DO NOT talk about yourself or the product<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasoning behind this is simple: <strong>the better your customers are educated (by you) on a subject that matters to them, the more likely they are to convert.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Useful types of content in this phase include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Blog posts (especially long-form ones)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Videos<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Webinars<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Comprehensive guides, long-form landing pages, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> In order to provide the most valuable information at this awareness stage of the conversion funnel\/user journey, find out what questions your audience has.

That includes the post-conversion behavior as well (retention, advocating, word-of-mouth impressions and so on).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A user journey is closely related to the concept of user experience (UX). It illustrates the way a user currently interacts with a brand, product or service and the way they COULD interact. The latter is a job for conversion optimization &#8211; a subject to which we\u2019ll get to in a few minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This journey is called a buyer journey if the conversion goal is making a purchase and it&#8217;s an integral part of every stage of the conversion funnel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, you may find it to be remarkably similar to the conversion funnel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, <strong>what is the difference between a user journey and a conversion funnel?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically &#8211; the conversion funnel helps a service provider or a business owner comprehend at what point of the journey users are and how to keep them engaged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user journey is a more broad phenomenon &#8211; it\u2019s used to define how a visitor behaves before they learn about the brand and its product\/solution (how they find out about a product or a service, how they decide to get to know it better etc.) and even after the conversion takes place. It\u2019s a map that encompasses a longer period of time and a wider range of user activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"box-cta -bg -border -narrow lazy colors-inverted\"\n     data-bg=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/website-strategies-1-655x230.jpg\">\n\n\t        <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/digital-trends\/website-strategies\" class=\"box-cta__wrap\">\n    \n        <div class=\"box-cta__text-wrap\">\n            <div class=\"l-heading-v3\">\n                <div class=\"c-heading -h2\">\n                                            <span class=\"c-heading__pre\">YOU MAY ALSO LIKE<\/span>\n                    \n                                            <div class=\"c-heading__title\">10 Website Strategies To Optimize Conversions<\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n\n        <div class=\"box-cta__icon\">\n            <svg class=\"icon icon-lib-icon-arrow-right-big \"  aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#lib-icon-arrow-right-big\"><\/use><\/svg>        <\/div>\n\n            <\/a>\n    \n<\/div>\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How-To-Map-A-User-Journey\"><\/span>How To Map A User Journey<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the abovementioned conversion funnel stages, you can devise a series of steps that the user will take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The end goal?<\/strong> Getting them to convert and become loyal customers!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/theuxreview.co.uk\/user-journeys-beginners-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The UX Review<\/a> recognizes these steps contained in a user journey:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Context<\/strong>: Here, you can think in terms of the user\u2019s whereabouts.

Do I answer the right question at every stage?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first frame of reference for a successful conversion funnel is the force of the value proposition, as MECLABS&#8217; managing director <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingexperiments.com\/value-proposition\/b2b-summit-value-proposition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Flint McGlaughlin<\/a> suggests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential customer will make a positive decision about your product or service at every stage of the conversion funnel <strong>if they are certain the value they are offered exceeds the cost they have to pay.<br><\/strong><br>To make sure they provide these small \u201cyes\u2019s\u201d en route to the major \u201cyes\u201d as the main conversion, be wary of the things that can cause them to say \u201cno\u201d and make them drop out of the funnel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with these questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is your content directed to the wrong persona?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does your content have enough value force?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does it have too much cost force?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does a part of your content come in too early and should it belong in a later stage of the funnel?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are you delaying the most important point?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Is the content at every stage at its most valuable state?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This outlines the importance of content relevancy. In the case of the conversion funnel, the relevancy is two-fold:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Relevant messages need to be sent to niche audiences<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Customers will engage in conversation with you when it\u2019s relevant to them (when a need for that arises)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the most valuable content doesn\u2019t only mean that it caters to the needs of the user. It also means being deployed at the exact right moment with the most helpful piece of information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. If the funnel is not working, where should I look for the \u201cleak\u201d and how can I fix it?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before launching the funnel, test the weakest links in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At the first stage of the conversion funnel, you should always make an amazing offer.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mistake most businesses make is to focus on the landing page and the checkout page only &#8211; the very top and bottom of the funnel, leaving the middle stages unoptimized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Brian Dean of Backlinko often suggests, conversion funnel makers should instead focus on fixing the bottlenecks. To do that, he suggests to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Outline every stage of a conversion funnel<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Measure the conversion rate of every step using analytics tools<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Focus on those with the lowest conversion rate where people abandon the user journey<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"TextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"heading 3\">Optimizing&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"heading 3\">Content&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun ContextualSpellingAndGrammarErrorV2 SCXW152933242 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"heading 3\">For<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"heading 3\">&nbsp;Every Stage&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun ContextualSpellingAndGrammarErrorV2 SCXW152933242 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"heading 3\">Of<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"heading 3\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun ContextualSpellingAndGrammarErrorV2 SCXW152933242 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"heading 3\">The<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"heading 3\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW152933242 BCX0\" data-ccp-parastyle=\"heading 3\">Funnel<\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXW152933242 BCX0\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.
