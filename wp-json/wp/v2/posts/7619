Brand Refresh: How To Rebrand To Reach New Audiences<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the most of your brand refresh, the best starting point is to research your new target market and a new audience to create a data-backed rebranding strategy. Here\u2019s how to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Define Your New Audience Personas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re expanding to a new market and targeting a new audience, you need to create new audience personas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When creating an audience persona, try to be as specific as possible:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Who is an ideal customer from your new target audience(s)?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How different are they from your existing customer persona(s)?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How do they typically interact with products in your category?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Which of their problems are your products or services going to solve?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What principles do they passionately defend?

How can you compete?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weaknesses:<\/strong> How can you make their weaknesses work to your advantage?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Opportunities:<\/strong> Is there a positioning gap you can fill with your unique approach?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Threats:<\/strong> What are the risks of entering your competitors\u2019 already established space?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Then, you can move on to more specific questions, such as:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>How will you introduce your brand to this new market?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Where can you reach your audience that your competition can\u2019t?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What type of campaign would be the best for growing market share?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is there anything you don\u2019t know about this new market and competitors?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Where can you find the answers, so you don\u2019t make any assumptions?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n    <div class=\"cta-custom-box\">\n                    <span style='color: #008dde;'>Request a brand audit &#038; custom proposal<\/span>\n                <a class=\"arrow-right black\" href=\"\/request-a-quote\/\"  rel=\"noopener\">\n            Request An Audit        <\/a>\n    <\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Revisit Your Brand Persona, Including Your Archetype, Values, Mission And Vision<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To position your brand on new markets, you also need to rethink your brand\u2019s foundation:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Has the <strong>purpose<\/strong> of your brand changed?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is your brand <strong>archetype<\/strong> still the same?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have your <strong>mission and vision<\/strong> evolved?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of a brand refresh, you might need to brush up your brand personality and adjust your brand messaging to speak clearly to new audiences. It\u2019s likely you won\u2019t move too far away from your original values, but it\u2019s still a good idea to take a fresh look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, more often than not, your brand archetype won\u2019t change drastically.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For example,<\/strong> if your existing brand is <em>The Caregiver<\/em> (think UNICEF), it typically isn\u2019t going to become <em>The Outlaw<\/em> (think Harley Davidson) overnight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Freshen Up Your Brand Voice<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the brand archetype, your brand voice probably won\u2019t change drastically, but you should revisit it and create clear guidelines to make sure it\u2019s used consistently across all channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could choose to <strong>add a splash of humor, a slice of sassiness or a dash of healthy rivalry to freshen up the way your brand communicates across channels.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, check out what fast-food chain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boredpanda.com\/funny-wendy-tweets-jokes\/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wendy\u2019s<\/a> did with humor on its Twitter account several years ago \u2014 it made their brand go viral!<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-3585\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalsilk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Rebranding-strategy-wendys-example.jpg\" alt=\"an example of Wendy's witty brand voice on Twitter\" class=\"wp-image-3585\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">[Source: Bored Panda]<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3>Reimagine Your Visual Identity<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important step of a brand refresh is <strong>the redesign of your brand\u2019s visual identity<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, it\u2019s probably not going to be a drastic change or complete reinvention, but rather a minor facelift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Changes in your visual identity may include:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A logo redesign<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A light <a title=\"Website Redesign Services\" href=\"\/web-design\/website-redesign-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website redesign<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new color palette<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new typeface<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom illustrations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you define your new style, you can apply it to business cards, stationery, marketing collateral, corporate website and other brand elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, <strong>consistency is key when it comes to your brand\u2019s visual appeal<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brand Refresh Example: Uber<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber started as a local on-demand transportation company, only to grow into a global network with an extension to food delivery and the logistics industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout its brand development, <strong>the purpose of the company has remained the same:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201c<strong>Purpose:<\/strong> Evolve the way the world moves.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, since the original mission has been accomplished \u2013 \u201cto acquire 40% market share for paid rides in the key U.S. metropolitan markets\u201d \u2013 Uber has rephrased its <a href=\"https:\/\/mission-statement.com\/uber\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">mission and vision statements<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201c<strong>Mission:<\/strong> Transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201c<strong>Vision:<\/strong> We ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current messaging addresses new goals, including those that will come with envisioned Uber Air and Uber Elevate, which will introduce VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircrafts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber is clearly growing, but it continues to remain true to its original purpose and keep brand messages relevant to both of its core audience segments \u2013 riders and drivers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-Brand-Merger-How-To-Rebrand-Following-a-Merger-or-Acquisition\"><\/span>2.

It will also help your marketing managers make better decisions about the <a title=\"Types of branding strategies\" href=\"\/digital-trends\/types-of-branding-strategies\/#6-Types-Of-Branding-Strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">branding strategy<\/a> and the rebranding rollout tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rebranding tactics will depend on the brand architecture that fits your company\u2019s situation.

Google Rebranding Campaign<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When Google rebranded G Suite into Google Workspace in October 2020<\/strong>, critics had a mostly negative opinion about it. Not regarding the new brand name or the rebrand itself, but mostly about the logo redesigns. Because, suddenly, all Google app icons looked almost the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cNow Gmail is just another rainbow shape in a sea of very similar rainbow shapes,\u201d<\/em> reported <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/06\/googles-new-logos-are-bad\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechCrunch<\/a> at the time of the rebrand announcement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, creating a unified look with recognizable Google colors was a reasonable move from Google\u2019s perspective. As <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/blog\/products\/workspace\/introducing-google-workspace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google announced<\/a>, the rebrand is going to help their customers to see Workspace \u201cas a product that brings together all the tools they need to get their work done.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Airbnb Rebranding Campaign<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2012, Airbnb\u2019s CEO Brian Chesky hired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3002813\/how-snow-white-helped-airbnbs-mobile-mission\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Pixar animator Nick Sung<\/a> to make the customer journey storyboards.
